                <p>I'm in 11th grade at Great Falls High School, Montana. Most of my time is spent doing policy debate and playing my bassoon. Otherwise, I love skiing, backpacking, mountain biking, and reading. </p>
                    
              <p> Speech and Debate: This is where the majority of my time is spent — our team spends about 2 hours every day practicing, and I have always been there for all 3 years.  </p>
              
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                  <li>Placed as follows at every meet this year, each of which included competitors from across the state: 1st, 3rd, 1st, 6th, 2nd, 1st, and 3rd.</li>
                  <li>Varsity letters in both my 10th and 11th grade years, as well as a <a href="https://www.speechanddebate.org/honor-society/" style="color: white; font-size: 1em; text-decoration: underline;">degree of special distinction</a> from the National Speech and Debate Association</li>
                  <li>Elected to the team executive board as Treasurer and Secretary, and later President. </li>
                  <li>So far, I have had ~100 rounds in ~15 tournaments, out of which over 60 have been wins.</li>
                </ul>

              Music: I play bassoon for our school band and city youth symphony. I also play saxophone for marching band, and I am proficient in both. Between private lessons and constant practicing, this also takes a large amount of my time.
              <ul style = "list-style-type:circle;color:e8e8e8">
                  <li>Received the honor of being an all-state musician every year of high school. This accomplishment has only been done once before in the last ten years of our high school, as it is very difficult to get this award in 9th grade. For 11th grade, I was principal bassoon in the orchestra, the highest position.</li>
                  <li>Selected to be section leader for all our school's double reeds this year. This role covers a wide variety of responsibilites, including holding regular sectionals, forming placing tests, and organizing the section while marching.</li>
                  <li>Awarded a superior rating at the annual city music festival, the only bassoon to do so, by playing the bassoon concerto by Jan Antonín Koželuh. This required proficiency in bass, tenor, and treble clefs. I later did the same playing Vivaldi's bassoon concerto in D minor.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Other School Activities:
              <ul style = "list-style-type:circle;color:e8e8e8">
                <li>DECA: This is a business club, in which I participated my junior year at the state competition. There, I recieved 1st, 1st, and 3rd in Principals of Business Management, Personal Finance Literacy, and Entrepreneurship, respectively. I also competed in Orlando at the international conference.</li>
                <li>NHS: For National Honor Society, I was elected treasurer and I work to head the fundraising aspect of our chapter.</li>
