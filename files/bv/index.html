The Servicer will determine that a proposed advance is non-recoverable (and consequently, that the related Mortgage Loan is a Stop Advance Mortgage Loan) when, in its good faith judgment, it believes the proposed advance would not ultimately be recoverable from the related mortgagor, related Liquidation Proceeds or other recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loan. For the avoidance of doubt, if a mortgagor enters into a repayment plan with respect to a Mortgage Loan, the Servicer or Master</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Servicer, as applicable, will reimburse itself for the related P&amp;I Advances over the course of such repayment plan from collections in respect of the related Mortgage Loan. To the extent the Servicer fails to make an advance of principal and interest (except to the extent such advance relates to a Stop Advance Mortgage Loan), the Master Servicer or the successor servicer will be obligated to make such advance and will be entitled to reimbursement as described in this Offering Memorandum.

However, the fact that examples are given should not be interpreted as meaning that such examples reflect all of the Mortgage Loans in the Issuing Entity to which such risk is applicable.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The COVID-19 Outbreak May Adversely Affect the Performance, Liquidity and Market Value of the Offered Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">There has been a global outbreak of a novel coronavirus and a related respiratory disease (“<b>COVID-19</b>”) that has spread throughout the world, including the United States, causing a global pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak (and any future outbreaks of COVID-19) and resulting emergency measures described below and elsewhere herein has led (and may continue to lead) to significant disruptions in the global supply chain, global capital markets, the economy of the United States and the economies of other nations, as well as extreme volatility in the stock market.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “<b>CARES Act</b>”) was signed into law, which is one of multiple economic stimulus packages providing wide-reaching protections for homeowners experiencing financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The provisions of the CARES Act included forbearance programs and policies, and permitted borrowers with federally backed mortgage loans (which are generally loans insured or guaranteed pursuant to certain government housing programs, such as by the Federal Housing Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, or U.S. Department of Agriculture, or are purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac), regardless of delinquency status, to request and obtain loan forbearance for up to a six-month period, which could be extended for another six-month period if required by the borrower. In addition to rights to request and receive forbearance, the CARES Act also provided for a suspension of furnishing negative consumer credit information during an accommodation, including a forbearance, deferral, modification or other assistance or relief related to COVID-19, and a 120-day moratorium on eviction filings for tenants in certain properties, including those with federally backed mortgage loans. Because the Mortgage Loans in this transaction are not federally backed, the policies of the CARES Act do not directly apply to the Mortgage Loans, but mortgagors with non-federally guaranteed mortgage loans that have experienced financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak have requested forbearance or other relief with respect to their mortgage payments and may continue to do so in the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The CARES Act also included the initial funding of $349 billion for the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (“<b>PPP</b>”) providing loans to small businesses so that they could keep their workers on the payroll, with loan forgiveness available subject to certain conditions. On April 24, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act was signed into law, adding $484 billion to existing programs that had either run out of money or were considered underfunded (including $310 billion for the PPP), as well as new funding for hospitals and health care as well as additional testing. The Second Stimulus (as described below) also provided for more than $284 billion for additional PPP loans to small businesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law, which was an omnibus spending bill that included a second COVID-19 stimulus bill (the “<b>Second Stimulus</b>”). In addition to providing stimulus checks for individuals and families, the Second Stimulus provided for, among other things, (i) an extension of federal unemployment insurance benefits, (ii) $25 billion in tax-free rental assistance, (iii) funding to help individuals connect remotely during the pandemic, (iv) tax credits for companies offering paid sick leave and (v) funding for vaccine distribution and development.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “<b>ARP</b>”) was signed into law, which was a third COVID-19 stimulus bill. In addition to providing a third round of stimulus checks for individuals and families, the ARP provides for, among other things, (i) extended unemployment compensation through September 6, 2021 (while making unemployment compensation nontaxable up to $10,200 for families making $150,000 or less), (ii) subsidies for COBRA health insurance premiums for uninsured workers, (iii) funding for those behind on rent, mortgages and utility bills, (iv) increasing the federal child tax credit while making it fully refundable,</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">funds for state and local governments to help compensate for lost tax revenues, (vi) school and childcare block grants, (vii) aid to multi-employer pension plans and (viii) subsidies for COVID-19 testing and vaccination programs.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “<b>OCC</b>”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “<b>FDIC</b>”), and the Federal Reserve Board indicated that member financial institutions can consider the use of modifications for borrowers with hardships related to the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, some states and local jurisdictions implemented requirements relating to payment forbearance and other relief, and moratoriums on foreclosures and evictions in efforts to lessen the impact that COVID-19 has had on Americans’ income and ability to pay their monthly mortgage and rent obligations (including in states where Mortgaged Properties securing the Mortgage Loans are located). The state and local requirements have prevented some mortgagors from evicting certain tenants who are not current on their monthly payments of rent and who qualify for relief under an eviction moratorium, which may present a greater risk that the mortgagor will stop making monthly mortgage loan payments. It is anticipated that some of these state and local forbearance programs, foreclosure moratoriums or other programs or mandates may be extended, including those that will impact the Mortgage Loans, although judicial challenge is likely to any extensions. Certain state and local foreclosure moratoria have been challenged in the courts and recently a portion of New York state’s foreclosure moratorium was ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. New York subsequently revised and extended the state foreclosure moratorium through January 15, 2022. Any state moratoria or bans could adversely impact the cashflow on the Mortgage Loans and therefore the performance of the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">On September 1, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “<b>CDC</b>”) issued an order effective September 4, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (and further extended through July 31, 2021) temporarily halting residential evictions to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. This eviction moratorium was challenged in the federal courts and the United States Supreme Court left the moratorium in place but signaled that any extension beyond July 31, 2021 would require congressional action. On August 3, 2021, the CDC issued a new moratorium targeted to counties experiencing the rapid spread of COVID-19 that was scheduled to be effective through October 3, 2021. On August 26, 2021, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the CDC had exceeded its authority and struck down the moratorium. Similar state eviction moratoria, however, may prevent some mortgagors from evicting certain tenants who are not current on their monthly payments of rent and who qualify for relief under such state eviction moratoria, which may present a greater risk that the mortgagor will stop making monthly mortgage loan payments. Any other similar state moratoria or bans could adversely impact the cashflow on the Mortgage Loans and therefore the performance of the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">On June 28, 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “<b>CFPB</b>”) issued a final rule (the “<b>2021 Mortgage Servicing COVID-19 Rule</b>”) amending the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X with the stated intent to seek to help prevent impending foreclosure actions as various emergency COVID-19 related foreclosure protections expire during 2021. The 2021 Mortgage Servicing COVID-19 Rule only applies to a mortgage loan secured by the borrower’s principal residence, and as such, generally does not apply to investment properties or second homes. The 2021 Mortgage Servicing COVID-19 Rule became effective on August 31, 2021. The 2021 Mortgage Servicing COVID-19 Rule includes temporary provisions that: (i) require special COVID-19 procedural safeguards and generally prohibits servicers from starting foreclosure until after December 31, 2021, with certain limited exceptions, (ii) provide servicers the ability to offer borrowers certain COVID-19 related streamlined loan modifications without a complete loss mitigation application, with certain limitations in place to protect borrowers who enter into a streamlined loan modification, (iii) amend the early intervention obligations to help ensure that servicers communicate timely and accurate information to certain delinquent borrowers regarding their loss mitigation options (this requirement only applies until October 1, 2022),</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and (iv) establish timing requirements for when servicers must renew reasonable diligence efforts to obtain complete loss mitigation applications from certain borrowers. The 2021 Mortgage Servicing COVID-19 Rule’s temporary restrictions on foreclosure and other requirements to provide additional information could delay or adversely impact the Servicer’s ability to manage loss mitigation strategies and therefore affect the cashflow on the Mortgage Loans and the performance of the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">As a result of COVID-19, the Federal Reserve also took emergency action to further cut its benchmark rate down to a range of between 0% and 0.25%, to inject additional funds into the short-term lending markets and to implement quantitative easing and other measures to support financial institutions, other businesses and the credit markets. In addition, in March and April 2020, the Federal Reserve in conjunction with the Treasury Department announced an extensive series of measures to provide liquidity and support to the economy, many of which were ended at the end of 2020 or the first quarter of 2021. Central banks in Europe, the United Kingdom and other countries have implemented similar and other measures to support financial markets. Although it cannot be predicted, additional action by the Federal Reserve as well as other federal and state agencies is possible in the near future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to the measures taken by the U.S. federal government, many state and local governments adopted a number of emergency measures and recommendations in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, including imposing travel bans, “shelter in place” restrictions, curfews, cancelling events, banning large gatherings, closing non-essential businesses, and generally promoting social distancing (including in the workplace, which has resulted in a significant increase in employees working remotely). While most states have partially or completely relaxed these measures, some restrictions on economic activity remain in place. Although it cannot be predicted, additional policy action at the federal, state and local level in the future may occur and such actions may result in further government actions or policy decisions that may adversely affect the market value of the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Concern about the potential effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and the effectiveness of measures put in place by governmental bodies and reserve banks at various levels as well as by private enterprises (such as workplaces, trade groups, amateur and professional sports leagues and conferences, places of worship, schools, restaurants and gyms) to contain or mitigate its spread adversely affected economic conditions and capital markets globally, and has led to significant volatility in global financial markets. There can be no assurance that the containment measures or other measures implemented from time to time will be successful in limiting the spread of the virus and what effect those measures will have on the economy generally or on any particular Mortgage Loan. In certain U.S. cities and states, the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted, at times, in a near total cessation of all non-essential economic activities, with some businesses temporarily suspending operations and laying-off employees, and many businesses including financial services companies permitting or requiring employees to work remotely. The disruption and volatility in the credit markets and the reduction of economic activity in severely affected sectors may continue for an extended period, and has led to a recession in the United States. While non-essential economic activity is returning or continuing in certain jurisdictions, the timing of a full return remains uncertain, and may vary substantially depending on the location and the type of activity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Furthermore, as a result of the measures discussed above, many organizations (including banks, trustees, servicers, courts and federal and state agencies) have either closed or implemented policies requiring their employees to work at home. Such remote working policies are dependent upon a number of factors to be successful, including communications, internet connectivity and the proper functioning of information technology systems, all of which can vary from organization to organization. As a result, such closures and remote working policies may lead to delays in otherwise routine functions that are not foreseeable at this time, including routine support functions on securitization transactions. In addition, to the extent that federal, state and local administrative offices and courts are closed, any foreclosures, recordings of assignments and similar activities will not be processed until such offices and courts reopen, and may be further delayed as such offices and courts address any backlogs of such actions that accumulated during the period they were closed. To the extent the related jurisdiction has implemented a moratorium on foreclosures, any processing of foreclosure actions would not commence until such moratorium has ended. As a result, there can be no assurance that such otherwise routine functions, including foreclosures, will be performed or processed on a regular or predictable timeframe. Furthermore, it is likely that the COVID-19 outbreak and resulting disruption to economic conditions will continue to adversely affect certain borrowers under the Mortgage Loans, which could result in an inability to make required mortgage loan payments and an increase in delinquencies with respect to the Mortgage Loans.  See also “—<i>Unemployment May Result in an Increase in Borrower Defaults</i>” below. The disruption in day-to-day business activities may also have an impact on the ability of parties to this transaction to perform their responsibilities. If any  transaction party or other relevant party  (such  as the Servicer,  the Master  Servicer or  the Servicing</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Administrator) is unable to adequately perform its obligations due to a remote working environment, this may adversely impact the performance of the Mortgage Loans and the timing and amount of distributions on the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In the event of further COVID-19 outbreaks or the spread of more contagious and/or more deadly COVID-19 variants, it is unclear whether the same mitigation or containment measures taken by various governments (including at the federal, state and local level) or private enterprises described herein will be reimplemented and the  degree to which such measures will be applied, or if  different  measures  will be implemented, and what impact such measures will have on the national or global economy. In addition, it is possible that, an increasing number of Americans who have emerged in varying degrees from lockdowns and other mitigation or containment measures related to the initial wave of COVID-19 may be less willing to return to such conditions, which could exacerbate the course of the pandemic.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">There is little certainty as to when and to what extent the United States economy will fully recover from the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Even with the number of new cases declining since the start of 2021, the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak will continue for an indefinite period of time, and a new outbreak may occur at a later time. The disruption and volatility in the credit markets may continue for an extended period or indefinitely, and it is unclear how deep these impacts in the United States will be or will last. Investors must consider and understand that the extent of the economic disruption and market volatility that has been, and may be, caused by the COVID-19 outbreak could be as severe, or even more severe, than that of the 2008 financial crisis or other similar economic crises. The risk factor disclosure contained in this Offering Memorandum related to the occurrence and consequences of the 2008 financial crisis and other similar economic crises, should be considered by investors also as potential consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, any of which could significantly and adversely affect payments on the Mortgage Loans and, consequently, distributions on the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The secondary market for mortgage-backed securities may experience limited liquidity, and such conditions could continue or worsen in the future. Recent volatility in the mortgage-backed securities market as a result of the COVID-19 related-economic disruptions could similarly result in liquidity issues. Limited liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage-backed securities could adversely affect a Certificateholder’s ability to sell its Offered Certificates or the price such Certificateholder receives for such Offered Certificates and may continue to have a severe adverse effect on the market value of mortgage-backed securities such as the Offered Certificates, especially those that are more sensitive to prepayment or credit risk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The long-term impacts of the social, economic and financial disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. While vaccines have been developed and disbursed throughout the United States in the past several months, in many areas limited uptake of the vaccines has allowed more contagious variants of COVID-19 to spread, especially as many areas relax COVID-19 mitigation efforts. Additionally, these vaccines have not yet been disbursed throughout the rest of the world other than in limited areas and many regions are experiencing severe COVID-19 outbreaks and the continued spread of more contagious and/or more deadly COVID-19 variants. Furthermore, even though the Federal Reserve, the U.S. government and other governments have implemented unprecedented financial support or relief measures in response to concerns surrounding the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the likelihood of such measures calming the volatility in the financial markets or preventing a long-term national or global economic downturn cannot be predicted. It is also unclear if vaccines will continue to be successful in slowing the COVID-19 pandemic or whether future economic shutdowns will be required in response to the development of a seasonal spread of COVID-19 or variants thereof. Further, it is unclear how many borrowers have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the COVID- 19 pandemic and if related efforts by federal, state and local governments to slow the spread of COVID-19 will continue to be successful. Regardless of the success of those efforts, it is expected that many borrowers will be adversely affected to some degree by the COVID-19 pandemic and related social distancing measures. It is possible that some borrowers will not have the ability to make timely payments on their respective Mortgage Loan at some point as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which, in turn, could result in delays in distributions on, or potential losses in respect of, the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align:

(iii) the mortgage and financial markets in general, either of which in turn may also have an adverse impact on the performance, liquidity and market value of the Offered Certificates.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unemployment May Result in an Increase in Borrower Defaults</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Large parts of the United States were placed on lockdown as a result of COVID-19 and millions of people working in retail, restaurants, travel, hotels, entertainment and leisure industries lost their jobs and job losses spread into other industries. Unemployment reached extraordinarily high levels as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, notwithstanding relief efforts such as the PPP, and while employment has increased over the past year, it is unclear when and if unemployment will return to pre-pandemic levels. Although government programs have been, and are continuing to be, enacted, it is not possible to predict at this time the effectiveness of any such programs. A mortgagor experiencing unemployment, or reduced employment, may be unable to (x) make their monthly payments of principal and interest on their Mortgage Loan, (y) refinance their Mortgage Loan, and (z) sell their Mortgaged Property for an amount sufficient to pay off the principal balance of their Mortgage Loan. Mortgagors may also prioritize payment obligations other than their Mortgage Loans if they experience, or anticipate experiencing, a loss in wages or employment. Unemployment rates may continue to be elevated compared to rates prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, which may result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults with respect to the Mortgage Loans and adversely impact the performance of the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Given the spikes in unemployment rates from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that mortgagors will avail themselves of available forbearance relief at higher or significantly higher rates than normal forbearance rates. Additionally, forbearance relief may not be available in the future and the Servicer may offer other forms of loss mitigation or foreclosure upon the related Mortgaged Properties. Investors should note that mortgagor credit scores may not reflect such mortgagor’s current creditworthiness, in the near term future as a result of the CARES Act requirements to suspend negative consumer credit information. Moreover, the Servicer may experience financial difficulties if mortgagors do not make monthly payments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of any forbearance or other mortgagor relief programs that are available. The negative impact on the business and operations of the Servicer as a result of sudden and widespread spikes in unemployment rates could be significant. Sources of liquidity available to the Servicer in normal times for the purpose of funding  advances of  monthly mortgage payments,  especially  servicers  that are  not  depository institutions, may not  be sufficient to  meet the  increased need that could result from significantly higher delinquency and/or forbearance rates. The measures to provide liquidity and support the economy discussed above are not designed to fund advance facilities for servicers of non-federally backed mortgage loans. See also “—<i>COVID-19 Outbreak Forbearances and Modifications May Impact an Investment in the Offered Certificates</i>” for a discussion regarding the potential impact of modifications and forbearances relating to COVID-19.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">COVID-19 Outbreak Forbearances and Modifications May Impact an Investment in the Offered Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Ordinarily, a REMIC that significantly modifies a mortgage loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes jeopardizes its tax status as a REMIC and risks having a 100% prohibited transaction tax being imposed on any income from the mortgage loan. A REMIC may avoid the potential negative tax consequences related to significant modifications of mortgage loans in REMICs if the related mortgage loan is in default or such default is “reasonably foreseeable” or “imminent,” as applicable, or other special circumstances apply. Since the commencement of the COVID-19 outbreak, many servicers have entered into COVID-19 related forbearances and loan modifications to ease the financial impact on mortgagors experiencing financial distress. In response, the Internal Revenue Service (“<b>IRS</b>”) issued IRS Revenue Procedure 2020-26, as amplified by IRS Revenue Procedure 2021-12 (together, the “<b>COVID-19 Revenue Procedure</b>”), which was issued to ease the potential negative tax consequences for REMICs related to forbearances and related modifications of mortgage loans held in a REMIC or being contributed to a REMIC by providing that certain forbearances and related modifications that were requested by or agreed to by a borrower during the period from March 27, 2020 through September 30, 2021 that were made under certain programs for mortgagors who, with respect to loans secured by one- to four- family residential properties, affirmed that they were experiencing financial hardship and, with respect to multifamily dwellings, who demonstrated that they were experiencing a financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 outbreak (a) were not treated as resulting in a newly issued mortgage loan for purposes of the Treasury regulations relating to REMICs, (b) were not prohibited transactions for a REMIC, (c) did not result in a deemed reissuance of related REMIC regular interests and (d) would not be treated as evidence that a REMIC had improper knowledge of an anticipated default that could prevent the REMIC from foreclosing in the event of a subsequent default. The COVID-19 Revenue Procedure expired on September 30, 2021. It is not clear whether the IRS will extend the application of the COVID-19 Revenue Procedure further or issue new guidance for forbearances and related modifications for mortgage loans in REMICs granted after September 30, 2021. While the Servicer may wish to grant certain forbearances or engage in related modifications with respect to a Mortgage Loan in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak, the Servicer may be limited in its ability to do</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">so pursuant to the terms of the transaction documents.

In particular, you should not commit to purchase any class of Certificates unless you understand and are able to bear the prepayment, credit, liquidity and market risks associated with that class of Certificates. As described below in more detail in this section of this Offering Memorandum, the yields to maturity and the aggregate amount and timing of distributions on the Certificates are subject to material variability from period to period and over the life of the Certificates. The interaction of the following factors and the other factors described in this Offering Memorandum and their effects are impossible to predict and are likely to change from time to time. As a result, an investment in the Certificates involves substantial risks and uncertainties and should be considered only by sophisticated institutional investors with substantial investment experience with similar types of securities and who have conducted appropriate diligence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Certificates are being offered in a private placement to a limited number of institutional investors in the United States and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state or foreign securities or “blue sky” laws, and no party is obligated to register the Certificates under the Securities Act or any such other laws. No transfer or sale of the Certificates offered hereby will be made unless such transfer is not subject to registration under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws, and is made in accordance with the other restrictions on transfer described in this Offering Memorandum. As a result, Certificates may be resold or transferred only to (i) “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in compliance therewith or (ii) other than with respect to the Class R Certificates, non-“U.S. Persons” (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) and in compliance therewith. The Certificates are subject to additional restrictions on transfer as described under “<i>Description of the Certificates—Limitations on Transfers of Certificates</i>,” “<i>ERISA Considerations</i>” and “<i>Notice to Investors.</i>”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investors Are Receiving No Assurance, Guarantee or Representation and Should Make Their Own Determinations and Seek Independent Advice</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">None of the Sponsor, the Seller, the Depositor, the Issuing Entity, the Representation Provider, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Custodian, the Servicing Administrator, any Originator, the Servicer, the Master Servicer or any of their respective affiliates makes any assurance, guarantee or representation as to the expected or projected success, return, timing or amount of payments, performance result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting, regulatory capital, legal investment or otherwise) to any investor of ownership of any class of the Certificates, and none of the foregoing will have a fiduciary relationship with respect to any investor or prospective investor in the Certificates. No investor may rely on any such party for a determination of expected or projected success, return, performance result, effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) in connection with its ownership of the Certificates. Each potential investor in the Certificates should consult with its own legal, regulatory, tax, business, investment, financial and accounting advisors regarding investment in the Certificates as it has deemed necessary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Certificates May Be Purchased by the Depositor</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">On any business day on or after the two year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Depositor may, at its option, purchase all of the Certificates at a price equal to the Optional Redemption Price. If prevailing interest rates for securities similar to the Certificates are lower than the then current Certificate Rates of the Certificates, the Depositor may be more likely to exercise its purchase right. Conversely, if prevailing interest rates for securities similar to the Certificates are higher than the then current Certificate Rates of the Certificates, the Depositor may be less likely to exercise its purchase right. There can be no assurance that the Depositor will purchase the Certificates on any Distribution Date.

Banks, mortgage companies, credit unions and others have reduced lending to mortgagors whose loans would not qualify for (i) sale to the GSEs, (ii) insurance or guaranty by the USDA, FHA or VA or (iii) sales to investors in prime jumbo loan originations, which has left a large segment of the U.S. population with limited access to mortgage credit. The Mortgage Loans were originated to mortgagors who do not generally qualify for traditional agency, government or private label non-agency jumbo products due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, prior housing or credit events, prior mortgage delinquencies, limited positive credit history, loan size, non-traditional income documentation or higher debt-to- income ratio. Originating loans to mortgagors that do not generally qualify for traditional agency, government or private label jumbo products that do not meet the requirements of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac may increase the risks associated with such loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The underwriting standards to which the Mortgage Loans were originated are generally more flexible than traditional GSE standards with regard to mortgagors’ credit standing. Generally the GSEs require a minimum of four years seasoning from a prior housing event (i.e. short sale, deed-in-lieu, charge-off or bankruptcy) and seven years seasoning from a completed foreclosure and the GSEs generally require no late mortgage payments in the most recent 24 months. Federal Housing Administration requirements are generally less onerous than those of the GSEs (i.e. three years from foreclosure and two years from bankruptcy) and allow one late mortgage payment in the most recent 24 months. Approximately 79.07% of the Mortgage Loans were originated by the Angel Oak Originators in accordance with the underwriting program of the Angel Oak Originators. The Angel Oak Originators’ underwriting programs provide credit access to mortgagors with housing or significant credit events in the recent past but compensate for this increased credit exposure through underwriting standards that mandate a more significant down payment or equity requirement than traditional GSE lending. The Angel Oak Originators’ underwriting standards, except with respect to Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loans, also require verification of at least 12 months’ income as documented by W-2s, tax returns or bank statements. The additional requirements of the Angel Oak Originators’ underwriting standards with respect to down payment and income verification are an attempt to offset the mortgagor’s prior credit history, including but not limited to prior housing events (foreclosures, short sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure). There can be no assurance that the underwriting standards and the Angel Oak Originators’ pricing requirements accurately predict the risk profile of the Mortgage Loans and the performance of the Mortgage Loans may materially differ from the performance of traditional GSE or non-agency jumbo loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Mortgage Loans originated with greater flexibility as to mortgagors’ credit standing include the following (percentages are based on the aggregate Scheduled Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">Angel Oak Bank Statement Program Mortgage Loans, which are designed for a prime or near- prime self-employed mortgagor who needs an alternative way to calculate their income. The typical mortgagor has been self-employed for a minimum of two years and utilizes 12 or 24 months of personal or business bank statements to calculate income based on cash flow from those accounts. A typical Angel Oak Bank Statement Program mortgagor may have a credit score that is lower than that required by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines or may have been subject to a bankruptcy or foreclosure not less than 24 months prior to origination. Effective generally on September 20, 2019, the Angel Oak Bank Statement Program was used to qualify all mortgagors whose income was calculated using 12 or 24 months of bank statements. Prior to that, such mortgagors were qualified under the Angel Oak Portfolio Select Program or Angel Oak Platinum Program. The Angel Oak Bank Statement Program also allows for mortgagors to qualify using the Angel Oak 1099 Program. Approximately 55.09% of the Mortgage Loans are Angel Oak Bank Statement Mortgage Loans;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loans, which may be made to real estate investors who would not qualify for an agency mortgage loan due to factors such as: credit score lower than GSE guidelines, more than the maximum number of permitted financed properties, lack of income</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">information or lack of employment information.

The Angel Oak Prime Jumbo Mortgage Loan guidelines follow Appendix Q of Regulation Z under TILA (“<b>Appendix Q</b>”) for income documentation requirements. The program allows for an interest-only feature. The loan amounts will exceed the conforming loan limits set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the “<b>FHFA</b>”) and will also allow high balance conforming loan limits; however, these loans will conform to all posted guidelines for the Angel Oak Prime Jumbo Program.

The pre- offering review of the Mortgage Loans is limited, only evaluates conformance with the related Originator’s Underwriting Guidelines and may not reveal every variance from such Underwriting Guidelines.

The inclusion of a Mortgage Loan in the Mortgage Pool is not a representation by the Sponsor that such Mortgage Loan was originated in substantial conformance with the related Originator’s Underwriting Guidelines; however, the Representation Provider will make a representation that such Mortgage Loan was originated in substantial conformance with the applicable Angel Oak Underwriting Guidelines, or applicable Third Party Originator Underwriting Guidelines, as applicable, or taking into account the compensating factors set forth in such Angel Oak Originator’s Underwriting Guidelines or Third Party Originator Underwriting Guidelines, as applicable, as of the Closing Date, without regard to any underwriter discretion or, if not underwritten in substantial conformance to the applicable Angel Oak Originator’s guidelines or Third Party Originator Underwriting Guidelines, as applicable, has reasonable and documented compensating factors. The sole remedy of the Certificateholders in connection with a Mortgage Loan that did not satisfy this representation and warranty is the obligation of the Representation Provider to repurchase such Mortgage Loan (or with respect to a Liquidated Loan, indemnify the Issuing Entity) or substitute an additional mortgage loan for such Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">There can be no assurance that the Originators’ Underwriting Guidelines and pricing requirements accurately capture the risks associated with the Mortgage Loans or how the performance of the Mortgage Loans, and ultimately the performance of the Certificates, will compare to the performance of newly originated GSE or prime jumbo mortgage loans or their related securitizations. Additionally, as the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to result in mortgagors under the Mortgage Loans becoming ill, losing their jobs or experiencing a reduction in wages, mortgagors may prioritize payment obligations other than their Mortgage Loans if they experience, or anticipate experiencing, a loss in wages or a job loss.

In addition, the Representation Provider reviewed diligence reports from a third party diligence firm to assess (i) compliance with the related Underwriting Guidelines and (ii) whether a Mortgage Loan subject to one or more exceptions to such Underwriting Guidelines should be approved for inclusion in the Issuing Entity. The Underwriting Guidelines may not identify or appropriately assess the risk that the interest and principal payments due on a Mortgage Loan will be repaid when due, or at all, or whether the market value of the related</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mortgaged Property will be sufficient to otherwise provide for recovery of such amounts. In addition, with respect to any exceptions made to the Underwriting Guidelines, those exceptions may increase the risk that principal and interest amounts may not be received or recovered and compensating factors, if any, which may have been the premise for making an exception to the Underwriting Guidelines may not, in fact, compensate for any additional risk. No assurance can be given that any Mortgage Loans complied with the Underwriting Guidelines or that any Mortgage Loans had compensating factors in the event that those Mortgage Loans did not comply with the Underwriting Guidelines. Furthermore, to the extent that the Underwriting Guidelines were not followed when originating or underwriting the Mortgage Loans, there could be an increased risk that principal and interest amounts may not be received or recovered. However, Mortgage Loans underwritten in accordance with the Underwriting Guidelines may still incur losses, and many prior securitizations of similar mortgage loans have incurred losses which have been allocated to the most senior classes of those securitizations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding any representations to  the contrary, certain Mortgage Loans may not have been originated or underwritten in compliance with the Underwriting Guidelines and may have taken into account certain compensating factors. For further information regarding the relevant compensating factors, see Annex B to this Offering Memorandum. Certain of the Mortgage Loans may have been originated or underwritten in accordance with Underwriting Guidelines that do not identify or appropriately assess repayment risk. However, the Representation Provider and the Sponsor decided to include such Mortgage Loans in the assets of the Issuing Entity when the Representation Provider and the Sponsor evaluated such Mortgage Loans and took into account any compensating factors. The inclusion of such Mortgage Loans could result in losses on your Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In any event, principal and interest amounts may not be received or recovered, regardless of whether the Mortgage Loans were underwritten in accordance with the related Originator’s Underwriting Guidelines.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Even without any exceptions, strict adherence to Underwriting Guidelines does not guarantee that a mortgagor will fulfill its financial obligations.

The ATR Rules were implemented by a final rulemaking issued by the CFPB that created new sections of Regulation Z, TILA’s implementing regulation, and which became effective for mortgage loans for which the application was taken on or after January 10, 2014.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A substantial majority of the Mortgage Loans were underwritten by the Originators with the intention of satisfying the ATR Rules. The Representation Provider will represent and warrant with respect to each Mortgage Loan that the applicable Originator made a reasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation that the mortgagor would have a reasonable ability to repay the Mortgage Loan in accordance with, at a minimum, the eight underwriting factors required by the ATR Rules and that each Mortgage Loan file contains all necessary third-party records and other evidence and documentation to demonstrate compliance with the ATR Rules. The Originators’ loan origination systems include tools to document and evidence that each of the eight factors</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">required by the ATR Rules has been assessed. See “<i>Description of the Mortgage Loans—Underwriting Guidelines</i>.<i>”</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Violations of the ATR Rules are enforceable by the CFPB through its administrative enforcement authority and by mortgagors through a private right of action against lenders or as a defense to foreclosure. Recoverable damages can include: (i) special statutory damages equal to the sum of all finance charges, points and fees paid by the mortgagor (capped at three years of finance charges, points and fees) unless the lender demonstrates that the failure to comply was immaterial; (ii) actual damages; (iii) statutory damages in an individual action or class action, up to a certain threshold; and (iv) court costs and attorney fees. A mortgagor must, however, bring such an action within three years of such alleged violation or such private right of action is extinguished. A mortgagor may also assert a violation of the ATR Rules in a foreclosure proceeding at any time following origination of the mortgage loan “as a matter of defense by recoupment or setoff,” but this right cannot bar foreclosure. The special statutory damages available for a violation of the ATR Rules can be up to three years of the sum of all finance charges, points and fees paid by the consumer. The likelihood of actual damages, which are uncapped, being awarded in an ATR claim is still unclear. While actual damages have been historically difficult to prove under TILA given that TILA is primarily a disclosure statute, the ATR Rules are more substantive in nature and may give rise to more frequent awards of actual damages. If a mortgagor asserts a defense to foreclosure due to a violation of the ATR Rules, the Servicer will defend the claim utilizing the evidence in the Mortgage Loan file including but not limited to the signed underwriter attestation as well as the evidence of compliance with the eight factors of the ATR Rules. As assignee of the Originators, the Issuing Entity may incur liability with respect to Mortgage Loans that do not satisfy the requirements of the ATR Rules. If a court of competent jurisdiction found a violation of ATR Rules, the foreclosure would proceed but the amount of the debt could be reduced by the recoverable damages set forth above. These claims may result in delays in foreclosure and additional costs may be incurred by the Issuing Entity in connection with such claims, even if any such claims by the related mortgagor were not successful, which may increase the severity of losses on any such Mortgage Loan. Such claims may be more likely in judicial foreclosure jurisdictions than in non-judicial foreclosure jurisdictions where there may be higher costs associated with a mortgagor making such claims, and it may be more likely that such claims are made in such jurisdictions since any such mortgagor would already be exposed to the judicial system to process the foreclosure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In connection with the establishment of the ATR Rules, the CFPB created enhanced legal protection for originators if they originated a loan to a more restrictive credit standard than just determining a mortgagor’s ability to repay. These rules specified the characteristics of a Qualified Mortgage, and two levels of presumption of compliance with the ATR Rules, a safe harbor and a rebuttable presumption for higher priced loans. A Qualified Mortgage must meet each of the following criteria: (1) terms of the mortgage loan must not include any negative amortization, interest only payments or balloon payments other than certain limited circumstances, (2) the loan term cannot exceed 30 years, (3) the lender must verify mortgagor income, (4) points and fees paid by the mortgagor cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount in most cases, (5) the lender must calculate monthly payments based on the highest monthly payments required any time during the first five years of the loan and the total “back end” debt-to-income ratio cannot exceed 43% and (6) the verification of income and assets and determination of the debt-to-income ratio must be in accordance with Appendix Q of Regulation Z under TILA.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certain types of mortgage loans, including certain of the Mortgage Loans originated by the Originators, such as loans with a debt-to-income ratio exceeding 43%, are among the loan products that do not constitute Qualified Mortgages. The CFPB’s rules may result in a reduction in the availability of these types of loans and may adversely affect the ability of mortgagors to refinance certain of the Mortgage Loans. No assurances are given as to the effect of the CFPB’s rules on the value of your Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Approximately 78.04% of the Mortgage Loans are Non-Qualified Mortgage Loans and do not have the benefit of either a safe harbor from liability under the ATR Rules or a rebuttable presumption from such liability. Therefore, Non-Qualified Mortgage Loans are subject to the potential for increased challenges in the ATR analysis used in qualifying a mortgagor. Even if the mortgagor does not succeed in the challenge, additional costs may be incurred by the Issuing Entity in connection with challenging and defending such claims. These mortgagor claims may be more  likely and more costly in judicial foreclosure jurisdictions than in non-judicial foreclosure jurisdictions, and there may be more of a likelihood such claims are made since the mortgagor is already exposed to the judicial system to process the foreclosure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Approximately 21.70% of the Mortgage Loans are Exempted Mortgage Loans which are not subject to the ATR Rules.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The inclusion of these Mortgage Loans may adversely affect the value of the Offered Certificates relative to mortgage-backed securities that are backed only by Qualified Mortgages. Investors may not be willing to invest in securities backed by pools of mortgage loans that are not Qualified Mortgages, which may negatively impact the broader residential mortgage-backed securities market and adversely affect the liquidity and market value of your Offered Certificates. In addition, the Qualified Mortgage rule may result in a reduction in the availability of Non-Qualified Mortgage Loans in the future and may adversely affect the ability of mortgagors to refinance their Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Importantly, there is little, if any, established case law as of yet with respect to both: (i) the substance of the ATR Rules, analyzing the consumer’s ability to repay and the weight and mechanics given to the rebuttable presumption of compliance, as well as (ii) the damages provisions and how they will be determined and allocated by a court. The lack of judicial precedent regarding the ATR Rules and potential claims increases the risk with respect to the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Various state and local jurisdictions may adopt similar or more onerous provisions in the future. We are unable to predict how these laws and regulations relating to assignee liability may affect the market value of your Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Certain of the Mortgage Loans Are Subject to the New “Know Before You Owe” TRID Disclosures</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Of the 841 Mortgage Loans, 557 Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 77.84% of the Mortgage Pool, are subject to the CFPB’s Know Before You Owe TILA – RESPA Integrated Disclosure (“<b>TRID</b>”) rule (the “<b>TRID Mortgage Loans</b>”), which became effective October 3, 2015. The 275 investor purpose Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 21.70% of the Mortgage Pool and the remaining 9 Mortgage Loans for which the application was received before October 3, 2015, representing approximately 0.46% of the Mortgage Pool are not subject to the TRID rule. TRID has been the subject of much commentary by market participants, including originators, investors, trade associations, the CFPB itself and members of Congress.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">TRID consolidated four existing disclosure forms that were previously required to be delivered to consumers in connection with a residential mortgage lending transaction under TILA and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“<b>RESPA</b>”) (the initial and final Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statements, the Good Faith Estimate and the HUD-1 Settlement Statement) into two new forms, the “<b>Loan Estimate</b>” and the “<b>Closing Disclosure</b>” and together, the “<b>Integrated Disclosure</b>.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Market participants have raised concerns regarding the Integrated Disclosures primarily along three lines:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l20"><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">Assignee liability. TILA provides for a private right of action for violations of its consumer lending disclosure provisions, including actual damages, statutory damages of up to $4,000 per violation, class action damages of up to $1 million or 1% of the creditor’s net worth, whichever is less, as well as attorney’s fees, court and other enforcement costs. Related to TILA’s private right of action is the possibility of assignee liability, at least in cases where an uncured violation is “apparent on the face” of the disclosure. Any such assignee liability under TILA may run to the Issuing Entity. RESPA, by contrast, does not provide for a private right of action for violations of its disclosure provisions, and thus issues of assignee liability do not arise under RESPA.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">Various provisions of the Integrated Disclosures are based on TILA requirements, while other provisions are either based on RESPA requirements or represent new requirements added by the CFPB that were not part of the prior disclosure forms. Consequently, a number of market participants have raised questions of whether a private right of action, and thus the potential for assignee liability, attaches to some, or potentially all, provisions of the Integrated Disclosures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">Technical or immaterial violations. The Integrated Disclosures contain a number of provisions regarding the format of the required disclosures, violations of which would appear to be technical or arguably “immaterial” – for example, certain items are required to be presented in alphabetical order, and certain percentages are required to be presented to a specified number of decimal places. Market participants have questioned what the consequences of such violations are, or should be, and the extent to which they can be cured.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">Ability to cure. TILA Section 130(b), “Correction of errors,” provides that a creditor or assignee “has no liability” under specified sections of TILA if, within 60 days of discovery of the error and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">before the institution of an enforcement action or receipt of a written notice from the consumer, the creditor or assignee notifies the consumer of the error and makes whatever adjustments in the appropriate account are necessary to assure that the consumer has not overpaid the amount or rate that was disclosed. Market participants have questioned the scope of these statutory cure provisions of TILA with respect to the Integrated Disclosures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">On December 29, 2015, the CFPB responded by letter (the “<b>CFPB Letter</b>”) to an inquiry from the Mortgage Bankers Association requesting guidance under TRID. In the CFPB Letter, the CFPB stated that, generally, TRID “did not change the prior, fundamental principles of liability under either TILA or RESPA,” and, specifically, for mortgage loans that are not “high-cost mortgages” under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (“<b>HOEPA</b>”):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">there is no general TILA assignee liability unless the violation is apparent on the face of the disclosure documents;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">TILA limits statutory damages for mortgage disclosures, in both individual and class actions for failure to provide the disclosure;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">formatting errors and the like are unlikely to give rise to private liability unless the formatting interferes with the clean and conspicuous disclosures listed as giving rise to statutory and class action damages under TILA; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">the non-TILA based disclosures contained in the Integrated Disclosures (i.e., the RESPA-based disclosures and the CFPB’s newly required disclosures) do not give rise to statutory and class action damages.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Based on the guidance provided by the CFPB in the CFPB Letter, the Structured Finance Association (“<b>SFA</b>”), an industry trade association, proposed in March 2016 a framework (the “<b>SFA Compliance Review Scope</b>”) in an attempt to provide a standardized approach to TRID compliance reviews. The SFA Compliance Review Scope states that the framework proposed therein is premised on the assumption that “the CFPB and the courts enforce the [TRID] rules in a manner consistent with the [CFPB Letter].” The SFA Compliance Review Scope also states that “the CFPB has refused to state formally that it will abide by” the SFA Compliance Review Scope.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Subsequent to the release of the SFA Compliance Review Scope, on May 12, 2016, the CFPB published annotated model forms (the “<b>TILA Mapping Forms</b>”) for the Integrated Disclosures. The CFPB has stated that the TILA Mapping Forms “do not represent legal interpretation, guidance or advice of the [CFPB].” The TILA Mapping Forms provide citations to TILA’s disclosure requirements for each section of the Integrated Disclosures on which the CFPB relied in adopting TRID. Certain of the provisions of the Integrated Disclosure that the TILA Mapping Forms indicate as arising under TILA, rather than RESPA, may not treated as such under the SFA Compliance Review Scope.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The CFPB Letter, although likely a “rule” under the federal Administrative Procedures Act (the “<b>APA</b>”), was not issued as the result of a “notice and comment” process conducted by the CFPB under the APA. Rather, the CFPB Letter is an “interpretive rule” or “general statement of policy” under the APA, and exempt from the notice and comment requirement. As a matter of federal administrative law, the courts generally find federal agency pronouncements that take the form of guidance issued outside of the notice and comment process, such as the CFPB Letter, to be entitled to a reduced level of judicial deference, and the issuing agency itself is less restrained in further issuing amended or even contrary guidance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In a letter (the “<b>AMI Letter</b>”) dated March 30, 2016 and following the initial release of the SFA Compliance Review Scope, the Association of Mortgage Investors (“<b>AMI</b>”) sent a letter to the CFPB stating AMI’s view that TRID “has resulted in a climate of legal uncertainty and is chilling private investment in the U.S. mortgage market.” AMI requested that the CFPB “open a new public comment period [on TRID] to address the concerns of mortgage investors” essentially requesting that a notice and comment process be undertaken. The AMI Letter goes on to detail numerous alleged deficiencies in the TRID regulation, stating that “the nearly universal feedback is that the [TRID] Rule is ambiguous and therefore viewed as extremely problematic.” AMI represents itself as being “organized as the primary trade association representing investors in mortgaged-backed securities.”</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In July 2016, the CFPB proposed amendments to the TRID rules which were finalized on July 7, 2017. These amendments were intended to clarify ambiguous provisions in the current version of the TRID rule by memorializing the CFPB’s informal guidance on various issues including, but not limited to: (i) creating express tolerances for the total of payments calculation that parallel the tolerances under TILA for calculating finance charges; (ii) adjusting a partial exemption for certain non-interest bearing subordinate lien transactions that provide down payment and other homeowner assistance; (iii) providing a uniform rule to include all cooperative units within the scope of the TRID rule (whether or not such cooperatives are considered real property under state law); and (iv) providing guidance in light of privacy concerns for sharing disclosures with various parties involved in the mortgage origination process, including sellers and real estate brokers. Importantly, the CFPB did not address in the amendments any issues related to cures for TRID disclosure errors or any resulting liability under TILA. These amendments became effective on October 10, 2017, however, compliance for most amendments is mandatory only with respect to transactions with application dates on or after October 1, 2018. The CFPB has established an optional compliance period between the effective date of October 10, 2017 and the mandatory compliance date of October 1, 2018, where subject parties were permitted to comply with the current version of the TRID rule and/or the amended version. While the amendments have clarified a number of questions with regard to TRID compliance, there is little, if any precedent of CFPB enforcement or judicial review. If there is an interpretation of TRID by a court of the CFPB that is different from the interpretation expected by the mortgage industry or from the interpretation applied by the Securitization Diligence Providers or the Originators, such an event could have an adverse effect on the market value and liquidity of the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">On May 2, 2018, the CFPB published a final rule addressing certain TRID issues not addressed in the amendments related to the redisclosure of loan-related fees and the determination of whether such loan-related fees were disclosed in “good faith” under the TRID rule. The final rule allows creditors to reset tolerances using an initial or revised closing disclosure regardless of the number of days remaining until consummation. The final rule can be applied to applications in progress as of June 1, 2018 or applications taken after that date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">With respect to the Mortgage Pool, AMC Diligence, Inc., Consolidated Analytics, Inc., Covius Real Estate Services, LLC, Evolve Mortgage Services, LLC, Infinity IPS, Inc. and Inglet Blair, LLC (the “<b>Securitization Diligence Providers</b>”) were retained by the Sponsor to conduct a review of each Mortgage Loan for compliance with the Underwriting Guidelines and for other legal compliance matters, including TRID compliance. See “<i>Description of the Mortgage Loans—Pre-Offering Review</i>” in this Offering Memorandum. The Securitization Diligence Providers’ TRID compliance review was based on the SFA Compliance Review Scope and outside counsel’s interpretation of the published regulations as of the date of review of each applicable Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Using the criteria set forth in the previous paragraph, the Securitization Diligence Providers assigned grades regarding compliance with applicable law, including TRID with respect to each TRID Mortgage Loan. Approximately 98.87% of the Mortgage Loans were graded “A” or “B” by the Securitization Diligence Providers regarding compliance with applicable law. The remaining approximately 1.13% of the Mortgage Loans are Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loans that were not reviewed for compliance with the TRID rule, RESPA or the ATR Rules by AMC Diligence, LLC. The Originators believed they made a good faith effort to address all TRID violations through the issuance of revised disclosures or other applicable remediation processes. However, certain instances of the TRID exceptions may not be curable due to timing or other factors and certain actions taken by the Originators to remediate TRID violations may not have been sufficient to cure such violation. See “<i>Description of the Mortgage Loans—Pre-Offering Review of the Mortgage Loans</i>” in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding the results of the Securitization Diligence Providers’ review, prospective investors in the Certificates should be aware that substantial legal uncertainty remains with respect to TRID, and that the SFA Compliance Review Scope framework applied by the Securitization Diligence Providers has not been adopted by either the CFPB or by any court. The SFA Compliance Review Scope itself is premised on the CFPB’s views as articulated in the CFPB Letter, and as a matter of federal administrative law, guidance issued by the CFPB in such a manner may not be afforded much weight by the court system, or even by the CFPB itself in issuing further guidance. In addition, the SFA Compliance Review Scope was published prior to the release of the TILA Mapping Forms and, as such, does not take into account the informal guidance set forth in the TILA Mapping Forms. As a consequence, we can give no assurances that the Mortgage Loans are free of any risks relating to the lack, or any alleged lack, of compliance with the TRID requirements, or that the Issuing Entity will not suffer any losses as a result of a finding of assignee liability with respect to any such TRID violations.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Underwriting Guidelines Have Evolved Since Their Inception</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Underwriting Guidelines of each of the Originators have evolved since their initial development in response to changing market conditions, regulatory and other legal guidance or clarification and other factors. Given this, certain characteristics or factors that may have constituted exceptions for Mortgage Loans acquired by the Seller during periods of time closer to the initial development of the related Underwriting Guidelines may no longer be considered exceptions as a result of the evolution of such Underwriting Guidelines. To the extent characteristics, factors or events exist that would have constituted exceptions during periods of time closer to the initial development of the related Underwriting Guidelines, such characteristics, events or factors may increase the risk that principal and interest amounts may not be received or recovered and the compensating factors which were the premise for making a modification to the related Underwriting Guidelines may not in fact compensate for any additional risk. You are encouraged to make your own assessment of the Underwriting Guidelines and the Mortgage Loans. See “<i>Description of the Mortgage Loans—Underwriting Guidelines</i>” in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mortgage Loans Made to Self-Employed Mortgagors May Present a Greater Risk</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Mortgage Loans made to mortgagors who are self-employed, which constitute approximately 75.37% of the Mortgage Loans (excluding Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loans), may present a greater risk that the mortgagor will default on the Mortgage Loan than Mortgage Loans made to salaried or commissioned mortgagors because, among other potential adverse factors, self-employed mortgagors frequently have less predictable income.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Approximately 69.60% of the Mortgage Loans (excluding Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loans) were made to self-employed mortgagors for whom the Originators did not obtain tax returns from the mortgagor in order to verify income and, instead, permitted those self-employed mortgagors to demonstrate income through use of the mortgagor’s personal or business bank account statements for the 12 or 24 months preceding origination in lieu of tax returns. In lieu of providing tax returns, the Angel Oak Originators also permit a self-employed mortgagor to demonstrate income through use  of the mortgagor’s  bank statements. An underwriter of the Angel Oak Originator reviews either 12 or 24 months of personal or business bank statements in order to determine an average flow of income from the business. With respect to the self-employed mortgagors with an application date generally on or after January 19, 2021 and where the Angel Oak Originators used the mortgagor’s business bank account statements to verify income, or to the extent the mortgagor used its personal bank account statements without the use of a separate business bank account to operate its business, the Angel Oak Originators applied a fixed 50% expense ratio to calculate the personal income of the mortgagor (without requiring any additional documentation from the mortgagor). Exceptions to this included certain business industries where a fixed 70% expense ratio was applied or cases where an expense ratio less than 50% was used which required additional documentation from a third-party CPA or tax preparer (subject to a minimum floor of 30%). With respect to the self-employed mortgagors with an application date generally on or after May 8, 2020 and generally before January 19, 2021 and where the Angel Oak Originators used the mortgagor’s business bank account statements to verify income, or to the extent the mortgagor used its personal bank account statements without the use of a separate business bank account to operate its business, the Angel Oak Originators applied a fixed 30%, 50%, 70% or 90% expense ratio based primarily upon the business industry and number of full-time employees to calculate the personal income of the mortgagor (without requiring any additional documentation from the mortgagor). With respect to the self-employed mortgagors with an application date generally on or after September 20, 2019 and generally before May 8, 2020 and where the Angel Oak Originators used the mortgagor’s business bank account statements to verify income, or to the extent the mortgagor used its personal bank account statements without the use of a separate business bank account to operate its business, the Angel Oak Originators applied a fixed 50% expense ratio to calculate the personal income of the mortgagor (without requiring any additional documentation from the mortgagor). For business bank accounts, any expense ratio less than 50% (subject to a minimum floor of 35%) would require either a third party prepared business expense letter or a third party prepared profit and loss statement. For personal bank accounts, any expense ratio less than 50% would require proof of specific business parameters (separate business account or home business with no employees), a third party prepared business expense letter or a third party prepared profit and loss statement. With respect to the self-employed mortgagors with an application date prior to September 20, 2019 and where the Angel Oak Originators used the mortgagor’s business bank account statements to verify income, the Angel Oak Originators used a fixed expense ratio, a third party prepared business expense letter or a third party prepared profit and loss statement or a CPA prepared business expense statement to determine such expense factor. Additionally, no expense factor was used to calculate the income when the Angel Oak Originators used the mortgagor’s personal bank statements prior to September 20, 2019 as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Any determination of “business income” from the use of such bank statements may not be a reliable indicator of the personal employment income of the business owner. In addition, there may be additional risks associated by (i) using a fixed expense ratio or (ii) using no expense ratio to calculate the income of a mortgagor using personal bank statements to the extent no proof of specific business parameters (separate business accounts) was received to calculate the personal income of the mortgagor using the business or personal bank statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Use of alternative documentation, such as bank statements instead of tax returns or verification through the mortgagor’s assets, may provide less certainty as to a mortgagor’s actual income, and mortgage loans underwritten using such alternative documentation may experience an increased level of default. The reasonableness of reliance on bank statements could depend upon a variety of facts and circumstances that would vary from borrower to borrower that could include seasonality of the business, the incurrence of irregular income or expense, deposits or withdrawals attributable to capital disposition or expenditures and other factors. Furthermore, many self-employed mortgagors are small business owners who may be personally liable for their business debt, which may result in less funds available to make payments on the related Mortgage Loan. Self- employed mortgagors may also be disproportionately impacted economically  by the COVID-19 outbreak. Consequently, investors should consider that a higher number of self-employed mortgagors may result in increased defaults on the Mortgage Loans. See “<i>Description of the Mortgage Loans—Underwriting Guidelines</i>” and “<i>Annex A – Certain Characteristics of the Mortgage Loans</i>” in this Offering Memorandum for a description of the underwriting criteria and mortgage loan characteristics related to these loans to self-employed mortgagors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Rate of Default on Mortgage Loans that Are Secured by Second Homes May be Higher than on Other Mortgage Loans</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Approximately 6.45% of the Mortgage Loans are secured by properties acquired as second homes. Second homes are typically used for vacation purposes and are not regularly occupied by the related mortgagors. Because the applicable mortgagor is typically not living on the related property, Mortgage Loans secured by second homes may present a greater risk that the mortgagor will stop making monthly payments if the mortgagor’s financial condition deteriorates than Mortgage Loans secured by primary residences.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Investors should also note, however, that mortgagor may have misrepresented the occupancy status on their applications. While the Originators have policies and procedures to address borrower misrepresentations, there can be no assurance that there is not a greater percentage of Mortgage Loans secured by second homes in the Mortgage Pool.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risks Associated with First-Time Mortgagors</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Approximately 18.49% of the Mortgage Loans were originated to first-time homebuyers. First-time homebuyers are often younger, have shorter credit histories, may be more highly leveraged and have less experience with undertaking mortgage debt and maintaining a residential property than other mortgagors. The presence of Mortgage Loans to first-time homebuyers in the Mortgage Pool may increase the number of defaults on the Mortgage Loans. The economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could cause the risk of default with respect to first-time homebuyers to be higher. Investors should note, however, that first-time homebuyers are generally defined in the mortgage industry to mean mortgagors who have not owned a primary residence in the past three years and not simply mortgagors who have never owned a home.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risks Associated with Secondary Financing on First Lien Mortgage Loans</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certain of the first lien Mortgage Loans may be secured by Mortgaged Properties that are subject to a second lien created at the time of origination of the related first lien Mortgage Loan, or in connection with secondary mortgage financing obtained by the mortgagors following origination of the first lien Mortgage Loan. In addition, the terms of the Mortgage Loans may not restrict the mortgagors from obtaining secondary financing on the related Mortgaged Properties. Such additional financing may increase a mortgagor’s likelihood of default, and may affect the rate of prepayment of the Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, with respect to such Mortgage Loans, foreclosure frequency may be increased relative to mortgage loans that were originated without a second lien (or for which the related mortgagor did not obtain secondary financing after origination), since mortgagors have less equity in the related Mortgaged Property. In addition, a default may be declared on the second lien loan, even though the first lien is current, which would constitute a default on the first lien Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Investors should consider that mortgagors who have less equity in their Mortgaged Properties may be more likely to default and may be more likely to submit to foreclosure proceedings. Because secondary financing was not known to the Depositor in many cases, a mortgagor’s actual equity may be less than the current loan-to- value ratios shown in this Offering Memorandum may suggest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risks Associated with Second Lien Mortgage Loans</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Approximately 0.03% of the Mortgage Loans are secured by a second lien on the related Mortgaged Property, which are subordinate to the rights of the mortgagee under the related first lien mortgage loan. Foreclosure frequency with respect to a second lien Mortgage Loans may be higher relative to first lien mortgage loans for which the related mortgagor did not obtain secondary financing, since mortgagors have less equity in the related Mortgaged Property. In the event that the holder of the first lien mortgage loan is successful in foreclosure of its mortgage, the second lien Mortgage Loan may experience a loss. In addition, due to the priority of the first mortgage, the Trustee may not be able to control the timing, method or procedure of any foreclosure action relating to the Mortgaged Property related to a second lien Mortgage Loan. Furthermore, any liquidation, insurance or condemnation proceeds received on a second lien Mortgage Loan will be available to satisfy the Unpaid Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan only to the extent that the claim of the related first mortgage has been satisfied in full, including any foreclosure costs. Accordingly, if Liquidation Proceeds are insufficient to satisfy a Mortgage Loan secured by a second lien and all prior liens in the aggregate, Certificateholders will bear the risk of delay in payments while any deficiency judgment against the related mortgagor is sought and the risk of loss if the deficiency judgment is not pursued, cannot be obtained or is not realized for any other reason.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, an overall decline in residential real estate prices could adversely affect the values of the Mortgaged Properties and cause the Unpaid Principal Balances of the second lien Mortgage Loans, together with the senior lien mortgage loans secured by the same Mortgaged Properties, to equal or exceed the value of the Mortgaged Properties. A rise in interest rates over a period of time and the general condition of a Mortgaged Property as well as other factors may have the effect of reducing the value of the Mortgaged Property from the Appraised Value at the time the second lien Mortgage Loan was originated. If there is a reduction in the value of a Mortgaged Property, the ratio of the sum of the principal balances of the second lien Mortgage Loan and the related first lien mortgage loan to the value of the Mortgaged Property may increase, reducing the likelihood of Liquidation Proceeds being sufficient to satisfy the second lien Mortgage Loan after satisfaction of the senior lien.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Investors should consider that mortgagors who have less equity in their properties may be more likely to default and may be more likely to submit to foreclosure proceedings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mortgage Loans with Large Principal Balances May Present a Greater Risk</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Approximately 30.00% of the Mortgage Loans have Scheduled Principal Balances in excess of</p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$1,000,000. These Mortgage Loans may present a greater risk than Mortgage Loans with a lower principal balance because defaults on a Mortgage Loan with a larger principal balance may have a disproportionate effect on the Mortgage Pool as a whole and result in greater losses allocated to the Certificateholders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Rate of Default on Mortgage Loans Made to Mortgagors with Higher Debt-to-Income Ratios May be Higher than on Other Mortgage Loans</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Approximately 17.18% of the Mortgage Loans were made to mortgagors with original debt-to-income ratio greater than 43%. These Mortgage Loans may present a greater risk that the related mortgagor will be unable to make monthly payments if the mortgagor’s financial condition deteriorates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risks Associated With Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Approximately 4.49% of the Mortgage Loans are adjustable rate Mortgage Loans whose mortgage rate was fixed for an initial period specified in the related Mortgage Note, but now adjusts on the basis of a variable index plus a margin. These Mortgage Loans may or may not have a low introductory mortgage rate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">As an alternative to traditional standard amortizing fixed rate mortgage loans, the primary attraction to mortgagors of adjustable rate mortgage loans is that initial monthly mortgage loan payments could be significantly lower than fixed rate mortgage loans under which the mortgagor pays interest at a mortgage rate fixed for the life of the mortgage loan. Mortgagors may take out adjustable rate mortgage loans in the expectation that (1) their income would rise by the time their fixed rate period expires, thus enabling them to make the higher monthly</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">payments or (2) in an appreciating real estate market, they would be able to sell their property for a higher price or would be able to refinance the mortgage loan before the expiration of the fixed rate period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Mortgagors with adjustable rate mortgage loans are exposed to increased monthly payments (1) when the mortgage rate adjusts upward from the current rate to the rate computed in accordance with the applicable index and margin or (2) if mortgage rates rise significantly. As the fixed initial mortgage rates on adjustable rate mortgage loans expire and convert to adjustable rates, to the extent that market mortgage rates have increased or may increase in the future, mortgagors may have found that the new minimum monthly payments are considerably higher, and they may not be able to make those payments. Furthermore, in recent years, mortgage rates have been at historically low levels. Although short-term interest rates have increased from their lowest levels, long-term interest rates have remained low. Regardless of temporary measures to reduce interest rates in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, if mortgage interest rates rise during the term of the Mortgage Loans, mortgagors will experience increased monthly payments on their adjustable rate mortgage loans. Slow wage growth in certain regions of the United States or generally or reduction or loss of wages as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak could exacerbate these risks. See “—<i>The COVID-19 Outbreak May Adversely Affect the Performance, Liquidity and Market Value of the Offered Certificates</i>” in this Offering Memorandum. If mortgage rates rise, mortgagors will experience increased monthly payments on their adjustable rate Mortgage Loans. Rising unemployment and slow wage growth in certain regions of the United States or generally could exacerbate these risks. As of the Cut-off Date, all of the adjustable rate Mortgage Loans are still in their pre-adjustment period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Current market conditions may impair mortgagors’ ability to refinance or sell their residential properties, which may contribute to higher delinquency and default rates. Mortgagors seeking to avoid increased monthly payments by refinancing may no longer be able to find available replacement loans due to more stringent underwriting standards. Despite recent home price appreciation in certain markets, home price depreciation experienced to date, and any further price depreciation, may also leave mortgagors with insufficient equity in their homes to permit them to refinance. Mortgagors who intended to sell their homes on or before the expiration of the fixed rate periods on their adjustable rate Mortgage Loans may find that they cannot sell their property for an amount equal to or greater than the Unpaid Principal Balance of their loans. These events could cause mortgagors, to default on their Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risks Relating to LIBOR</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Approximately 95.36% of the Mortgage Loans that are adjustable rate Mortgage Loans have mortgage rates that adjust in accordance with an index based on the average of the interbank offered rates for one-year United States deposits in the London market based on quotations of major banks (“<b>LIBOR</b>”). LIBOR serves as a global benchmark for home mortgages, student loans and what various issuers pay to borrow money. Certain financial institutions have been accused by various regulators of manipulating LIBOR, and have been alleged to have altered costs when reporting it to regulators. In addition to ensuing regulatory investigations, lawsuits have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking damages for losses arising from alleged LIBOR manipulation. While certain causes of action with respect to such lawsuits have been dismissed or settled, others continue to be litigated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">It is unknown at this time what effect, if any, these investigations or any related litigation will have on the use of LIBOR as a global benchmark going forward. We cannot provide any assurances that the rate-setting process for LIBOR will not be affected by conduct similar to what has been alleged in the future, or that the investigations into the rate-setting process will not result in changes in the process used to determine LIBOR that could result in a disruption in the rate-setting process and, consequently, adversely affect the market value or performance of the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, on July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive Officer of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the “<b>FCA</b>”) announced that by the end of 2021, the London Interbank Offered Rate would no longer be sustained through the FCA’s efforts to compel banks’ participation in setting the benchmark. In the announcement, the Chief Executive Officer of the FCA stated that the London interbank market is no longer sufficiently active to determine reliable rates. Thereafter, on November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (the “<b>IBA</b>”), the entity responsible for administering LIBOR, announced a plan to extend the date that certain tenors of LIBOR would no longer be computed until June 30, 2023 (the “<b>LIBOR Phase-Out Date</b>”). It is not currently known whether the IBA will continue to quote LIBOR with respect to such tenors after the LIBOR Phase-Out Date. The IBA has not proposed an alternative benchmark rate, nor has it outlined a process or schedule for introducing an alternative benchmark rate, if any.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Following the LIBOR Phase-Out Date, LIBOR may be determined on alternative bases, some of which may also be unavailable or adversely affected due to the decline of London interbank market activity. In the event one or more of such alternative rates are unavailable, the Servicer (in consultation with the Servicing Administrator), on behalf of the Issuing Entity, under the terms of each Mortgage Note, may use a different index which is viewed as comparable. Any such alternative index may have a negative effect on payments received on the related Mortgage Loans if the LIBOR global benchmark is no longer available.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Master Servicer, the Custodian or the Initial Purchasers will have any duty or responsibility to monitor the availability of, or make any determinations regarding, LIBOR, an alternative index or a replacement reference rate therefor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Use of an Alternative Method or Index in Place of LIBOR for Determining Mortgage Rates May Result in Adverse Tax Consequences to the Offered Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In the absence of final Treasury regulations from the IRS, if an alternative method or index is designated in place of LIBOR for determining mortgage rates in respect of the adjustable rate Mortgage Loans that currently adjust based on LIBOR, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such a replacement are uncertain. If such replacement is deemed a “significant modification” of the related Mortgage Note for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then such modification could result in a deemed taxable exchange of such Mortgage Note and the realization of gain or loss, as well as other corollary tax consequences, including, the termination of the Issuing Entity’s status as a REMIC, potentially resulting in the related REMIC’s being taxable as one or more corporations and causing one or more related REMIC regular interests to lose their status as debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Proposed Treasury regulations address the U.S. federal income tax consequences resulting from replacing LIBOR with a substitute index. These regulations grant relief from the above-mentioned consequences for alterations but are conditioned on certain criteria. It is uncertain whether any particular modification will satisfy such criteria as written. In addition, the regulations may not be finalized in their current form, which means that the criteria for relying on them may become more difficult to satisfy. Therefore, at this time it is unknown whether such regulatory relief will actually be available for obligations such as the adjustable rate Mortgage Loans that do not incorporate the fallback language recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“<b>ARRC</b>”).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In October 2020, the IRS issued IRS Revenue Procedure 2020-44 to facilitate the market’s transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates through adoption of fallback language recommended by the ARRC as well as by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“<b>ISDA</b>”). IRS Revenue Procedure 2020-44 is intended to support the use of the ARRC and ISDA alternatives by providing that certain modifications made to adopt those alternatives will not result in a deemed taxable exchange and certain other adverse tax consequences.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Like the proposed Treasury regulations, the protections provided under IRS Revenue Procedure 2020- 44 are conditioned on certain criteria and if such criteria are not satisfied a loan adopting an otherwise permissible fallback may still give rise to adverse tax consequences. The fallback contractual language used must be based on contractual language included in one of the listed recommendations published by ARRC or ISDA.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Special Risks Associated with Rental Properties</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certain of the Mortgage Loans may be secured by rental properties. Underwriting decisions with respect to Mortgage Loans secured by rental property are generally based on the value of the rental property, the mortgagor’s or the guarantor’s credit score (in each case, to the extent applicable) and the rental property’s potential to generate income (which may be based on projected rental rates or short-term rental rates). In the event a rental property is unable to generate enough income to make the required payments on the related Mortgage Loan, there can be no assurance that the mortgagor will have funds sufficient to meet its obligations with respect to such Mortgage Loan. The economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could further impair the ability of the mortgagor to collect rental payments or increase the risk that tenants may fail to pay their rental payments. This may result in increased delinquencies by the related mortgagors. There may also be restrictions on eviction imposed by state and local orders as well as delays as a result of current court closures and backlogs upon reopening. See also “<i>—Dependence on Tenants May Result in an Inability of Mortgagors to Make Payments on the Mortgage Loans” </i>in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Investors should note that mortgage loans secured by rental properties may have a greater likelihood of delinquency and foreclosure, and a greater likelihood of loss in the event thereof, than mortgage loans secured by</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">owner occupied single-family residential properties. In a default, mortgagors who do not reside in the mortgaged property may be more likely to abandon the related mortgaged property, increasing the severity of the default. The ability of a related mortgagor with respect to a mortgage loan to repay an owner occupied single family loan typically depends primarily on such mortgagor&#39;s household income rather than on the capacity of the mortgaged property to appreciate in value or produce income. Accordingly, a decline in the income of a mortgagor on a loan secured by an owner occupied single family mortgaged property may adversely affect the performance of the mortgage loan, but may not directly affect the liquidation value of such mortgaged property. In contrast, the ability of a mortgagor to repay a loan secured by an investment property typically depends primarily on (i) the successful operation and management of such mortgaged property, rather than on any independent income or assets of the mortgagor or (ii) the mortgagor&#39;s ability to realize the value of such mortgaged property (e.g. via refinancing or profitable disposition). In some cases, the mortgagor may have no material assets other than the mortgaged property. As a result, if the net operating income of the mortgaged property is reduced (for example, if rental or occupancy rates decline, competition increases, or real estate tax rates or other operating expenses increase), the mortgagor&#39;s ability to repay the mortgage loan may be impaired, and the liquidation value of the related mortgaged property also may be adversely affected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Although the Originators took certain steps in connection with its origination process to confirm that each of these Mortgage Loans were primarily made for a business or commercial purpose, a regulatory authority could find that a Mortgage Loan was originated as a consumer loan (i.e., primarily for personal, family or household use, and therefore subject to various consumer protection laws). Violations of consumer protection laws may limit the ability of the Issuing Entity to collect all or part of the principal or interest on such Mortgage Loan, may result in a defense to foreclosure or an “unwinding” or rescission of the Mortgage Loan and may entitle the mortgagor to a refund of amounts previously paid. Even though a mortgagor may make certain representations regarding such mortgagor’s intent with respect to utilizing a property primarily for a business purpose, the mortgagor may have misrepresented the intended purpose of the loan or have changed circumstances such that the proceeds of the loan may ultimately be used for personal, family, or household purposes. Therefore, a Mortgage Loan may be originated in accordance with applicable law and not be considered a breach of any representation and warranty made by the Representation Provider even if such Mortgage Loan proceeds and the property are used for a consumer purpose. In such a case, the mortgagor’s ability to repay such Mortgage Loan may be impaired if such property is not a profitable investment property, and the liquidation value of the related Mortgaged Property may also be adversely affected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Additional Risks

or local politics.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certain states regulate the relationship of a landlord and its tenants. Commonly, these laws may require a written lease, good cause for eviction, disclosure of fees and notification to residents of changed land use, while prohibiting unreasonable rules and retaliatory evictions. Property owners have been the subject of suits under state “Unfair and Deceptive Practices Acts” and other general consumer protection statutes for coercive, abusive or unconscionable leasing and sales practices. A few states offer more significant protection. For example, in some states there are provisions that limit the basis on which a landlord may terminate a tenancy or increase rent or prohibit a landlord from terminating a tenancy solely by reason of the sale of the owner’s property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to state regulation of the landlord-tenant relationship, numerous counties and municipalities impose rent control on rental investment properties. These ordinances may limit rent increases to fixed percentages, to percentages of increases in the consumer price index, to increases set or approved by a governmental agency, or to increases determined through mediation or binding arbitration. Any limitations on a mortgagor’s ability to raise property rents may impair such mortgagor&#39;s ability to repay its mortgage loan from its net operating income or the proceeds of a sale or refinancing of the related mortgaged property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, investment properties are part of a market that, in general, is characterized by low barriers to entry. Thus, a particular rental housing property market with historically low vacancies could experience substantial new construction and a resultant oversupply of rental units within a relatively short period of time. Because rental housing properties are typically leased on a short-term basis, the tenants residing at a particular property may easily move to alternative rental properties with more desirable amenities or locations once a lease expires and high turnover may result in increased costs to the related mortgagor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Numerous tenants’ rights and consumer rights organizations exist throughout the country and a mortgagor may become a target of legal demands or litigation. Many such consumer rights organizations have become more active and better funded in connection with mortgage foreclosure related issues, and with the large settlements and the increased market for residential rentals arising from displaced homeownership, litigation, lobbying, fundraising and grass roots organizing activities focusing on landlord-tenant issues may increase. Additionally, these organizations may lobby local county and municipal attorneys or state attorneys general to pursue enforcement or litigation against a mortgagor, or may lobby state and local legislatures to pass new laws and regulations to constrain a mortgagor’s business operations. If they are successful in any such endeavors, they could directly limit and constrain a mortgagor’s business operations. Such efforts may result in significant litigation expenses, including settlement costs to avoid continued litigation, judgments for damages or injunctions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Mortgaged properties and mortgagors may be subject to claims for taxes or special assessments and mortgagors may also be subject to litigation relating to workers’ compensation, professional liability, general liability, automotive liability and/or employment practices liability. No assurance can be given that any insurance</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">maintained by a mortgagor, even to the extent required by the related Mortgage Loan documents, will be adequate to cover litigation expenses and claims. Such claims and liability could materially affect a mortgagor’s future results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on a mortgagor’s ability to make its debt service payments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">As a landlord, mortgagors will collect and retain certain personal information provided by their tenants. There is no assurance that a mortgagor will be successful in preventing unauthorized access to this information. Any loss or release of such information may result in legal liability and costs (including damages and penalties) and damage to the reputation of a mortgagor. This may materially and adversely affect a mortgagor’s business and operating results.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Some of the Mortgage Loans may be secured by Mortgaged Properties that have tenants as of the date of origination that rely on rent subsidies under various government-funded programs or otherwise receive benefits from various governmental affordable housing programs. No party to this transaction makes any representation that such programs will be continued in their present form or that the level of assistance provided will be sufficient to generate enough revenues for the related mortgagors to meet their respective obligations under the related Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maintaining a Property in Good Condition May Be Costly</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The failure to maintain a rental property may materially impair the property’s ability to generate cash flow. In addition to general maintenance, over time, rental property may require renovation and capital improvements to remain competitive. Such improvements may be required frequently to the extent the leases are short-term. The cost of necessary maintenance, renovation and/or capital improvements may be substantial. There can be no assurance that rental property securing a Mortgage Loan will generate sufficient cash flow to cover these costs while still satisfying debt service requirements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Failure to Enforce Certain Aspects of the Mortgage Loans May Result in Delays in Distributions on the Offered Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certain investor Mortgage Loans will be secured in part by an assignment of leases and rents pursuant to which each of the related mortgagors typically assigns its right, title, and interest as landlord under the leases on the related Mortgaged Property, and the income derived therefrom, to the lender as further security for the related Mortgage Loan, while retaining a license to collect rents for so long as there is no default. In the event the mortgagor defaults, the license terminates and the lender is entitled to collect the related rents. Such assignments are typically not perfected as security interests prior to actual possession of the cash flows. Some state laws may require that the lender in such circumstances take possession of the mortgaged property and obtain a judicial appointment of a receiver before becoming entitled to collect the rents. In addition, if bankruptcy or similar proceedings are commenced by or in respect of the mortgagor, the lender&#39;s ability to collect the rents may be adversely affected. Investors in the Offered Certificates should be aware that the economic impact of the COVID- 19 outbreak could increase the risk of bankruptcy or similar proceedings with respect to the mortgagors of these Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lack of Attornment Provisions in Leases Could Result in Losses on the Mortgage Loans</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Some tenant leases associated with the Mortgaged Properties may contain certain provisions that require the tenant to attorn to (i.e., recognize as landlord under the lease) a successor owner of the property following foreclosure. Some of the leases may be either subordinate to the liens created by the Mortgage Loans or else contain a provision that requires the tenant to subordinate the lease if the mortgagee agrees to enter into a non- disturbance agreement. In some states, if a tenant lease is subordinate to the lien created by a Mortgage Loan and such lease does not contain attornment provisions, such leases may terminate upon the transfer of the property to a foreclosing lender or purchaser at foreclosure. Accordingly, in the case of the foreclosure of a Mortgaged Property located in such a state and leased to one or more desirable tenants under leases that do not contain attornment provisions, the value of such Mortgaged Property could be adversely affected if such tenants&#39; leases were terminated, particularly, if such tenants were paying above-market rents. If a mortgage loan is subordinate to a lease, the lender will not (unless it has otherwise agreed with the tenant) have the right to dispossess the tenant upon foreclosure of the property (unless the tenant is in default), and if the lease contains provisions inconsistent with the mortgage (e.g., provisions relating to application of insurance proceeds or condemnation awards), the provisions of the lease generally take precedence over the provisions of the mortgage.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dependence on Tenants May Result in an Inability of Mortgagors to Make Payments on the Mortgage Loans</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The mortgagor of an investor Mortgage Loans generally relies on periodic lease or rental payments from tenants to pay for maintenance and other operating expenses of the rental property, to fund capital improvements and to service the Mortgage Loan and any other outstanding debt or obligations. There can be no guarantee that tenants will renew leases upon expiration. The income of the mortgagors under such Mortgage Loans will be adversely affected if tenants are unable to pay rent or if space cannot be rented on favorable terms or at all. Changes in payment patterns by tenants may result from a variety of social, legal and economic factors, including, without limitation, the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, the rate of inflation and unemployment levels, and may be reflected in the rental rates offered for comparable space. There will be existing leases that expire during the term of the related Mortgage Loans and there can be no assurance that such leases will be renewed. In addition, some of the Mortgaged Properties securing the investor Mortgage Loans may have only month-to-month leases, some of which may be verbal, and there can be no assurance that such leases will be renewed each month. Certain other tenants may be permitted to terminate their leases on or after a specified date upon giving notice and/or payment of certain amounts specified in the applicable lease. There can be no assurance that such termination rights will not arise in the future. There can be no assurances whether, or to what extent, economic, legal or social factors will affect future rental or repayment patterns.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">To the extent that leases to tenants in Mortgaged Properties expire and are unable to be renewed, the related mortgagors may be unable to continue to make payments on the related Mortgage Loans which would adversely affect the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The COVID-19 outbreak may cause tenants to remain in their current accommodations, potentially increasing the risk that Mortgaged Properties that are currently vacant may remain vacant for a longer period of time, or that the related mortgagor may need to offer rent concessions in order to find a tenant to lease such Mortgaged Property, which, in each case, could adversely affect cash flow on the related Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Skillful Property Management Is Integral to Mortgagor Performance</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The successful operation of a rental property depends upon the mortgagor’s (or, if applicable, a property manager’s) ability to manage the revenues, expenses and value of a mortgaged property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A mortgagor, by controlling costs, providing appropriate service to tenants and seeing to the maintenance of improvements, can improve cash flow, reduce vacancy, leasing and repair costs and preserve a mortgaged property’s value. On the other hand, management errors can, in some cases, impair short-term cash flow and the long-term viability of a rental property. Many investors have entered the residential investment property space, but many of them may not have a long history in managing residential investment properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Investors in the Offered Certificates should consider the risk that Mortgaged Properties that are self- managed by mortgagors may be more likely to default on the related Mortgage Loans than Mortgaged Properties that are managed by an experienced property manager on behalf of a mortgagor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Failure of a mortgagor (or a property manager on behalf of a mortgagor) to properly manage a Mortgaged Property could lead to defaults and therefore adversely affect the cash flow available to pay the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Homesharing Could Present Unique Risks with Respect to the Mortgaged Properties</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">There may be Mortgage Loans secured by properties that are not true investor properties, but are rented out on a limited basis through homesharing platforms such as the platform operated by Airbnb, Inc. Although such Mortgage Loans share some of the same risks as investor properties, they present additional risks created by the unregulated nature of homesharing practices. For example, mortgagors who regularly rent out their properties risk having their primary homeowner’s insurance policies invalidated if additional business or landlord coverage is not obtained. Although some homesharing services offer secondary coverage, homeowners must file a claim with their primary homeowner’s insurance policy first. In addition, unregulated homesharing or subletting for a term of less than 30 days is generally not permitted by most localities and could result in significant penalties for repeated violations. In some jurisdictions, an unpaid penalty may give rise to a special assessment lien on a property which could take priority over a first lien mortgage or result in foreclosure. In the event of a foreclosure, guests who are legally classified as tenants may need to be evicted through court proceedings.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">None of the Sponsor, the Depositor, the Issuing Entity, the Servicing Administrator, the Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Custodian, the Initial Purchasers or any other transaction party has independently verified the occupancy status of any home, and any information provided in this Offering Memorandum as to owner occupancy is based solely on the representation made by the related mortgagor in connection with the origination of the related Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If a mortgagor relies on income from homesharing services to make its monthly mortgage payments, due to social distancing and other limitations related to the COVID-19 outbreak, such a mortgagor may have increased difficulties in making its monthly payment.

Furthermore, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is likely that delinquencies and losses on the Mortgage Loans will increase, and such increase could be substantial. Mortgagors in the Mortgage Pool may have contacted or in the future could contact the Servicer indicating financial distress as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and/or request relief which could increase the number of mortgagors in the Mortgage Pool who receive forbearance or other loss mitigation options due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

As of the Cut-off Date, none of the mortgagors with respect to the Mortgage Loans were subject to active bankruptcy proceedings. Virtually all actions by creditors against a mortgagor, including foreclosure actions, are stayed upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition. Frequently, no payments of interest or principal are made on a mortgage loan during the mortgagor’s bankruptcy case. In addition, a bankruptcy court may, (i) reduce or eliminate the security interest of the mortgage in the related Mortgaged Property, leaving the mortgagee as an unsecured creditor for the remainder of the loan balance, and/or (ii) modify the payment terms of such mortgage loan. These and other aspects of bankruptcy proceedings could delay payments, reduce the yields or, under certain loss scenarios, cause principal and interest received on the Mortgage Loans to be insufficient to pay the Certificates all principal and interest to which they are entitled. Additionally, many of the mortgagors may previously have been subject to bankruptcy proceedings. A mortgagor who has previously filed for bankruptcy protection may be more likely to default or file for bankruptcy protection in the future. Further, the COVID-19 Outbreak may also result in an increased number of mortgagors filing for bankruptcy protection.

The Certificates also have significant transfer restrictions, including the restriction that any purchaser must be (i) a “qualified institutional buyer” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act or (ii) other than with respect to the Class R Certificates, a non-“U.S. Person” as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Depositor has been advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market in the Purchased Certificates but the Initial Purchasers have no obligation to do so. No representation is made by any person or entity as to what the market value of any Certificate will be at any time. In recent years, the residential mortgage-backed securities (“<b>RMBS</b>”) market has experienced greatly reduced liquidity and could continue to experience significant disruptions resulting from reduced investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage- backed securities, increased investor yield requirements and fluctuating investor confidence. Currently, the COVID-19 outbreak is causing significant disruption in the RMBS market. There can be no assurance that a secondary market for the Certificates will develop or, if it does develop, that it will continue. Accordingly, you may not have an active or liquid secondary market for your Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">It is possible that investors who desire to sell their Certificates in the secondary market may find no or few potential purchasers and experience lower resale prices than expected. Investors who desire to obtain financing for their Certificates similarly may have difficulty obtaining any credit or credit with satisfactory interest rates which may result in lower leveraged yields and lower secondary market prices upon the sale of the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">We make no representation as to the proper characterization of the Certificates for legal investment, regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to purchase the Certificates under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the Certificates for such purposes or under such restrictions. However, the following are examples of statutory and regulatory developments that may adversely affect the ability of particular investors to hold or acquire RMBS or the consequences to them of an investment in RMBS and, thus, the ability of investors in the Certificates to resell their Certificates in the secondary market.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. federal banking agencies and other federal regulators to modify their existing regulations to remove any reliance on credit ratings and establish alternative standards of credit-worthiness. As a general rule, national banks are permitted to invest only in “investment grade” instruments, which under pre-existing regulations has been determined based on the credit ratings assigned to these instruments. These national bank investment-grade standards are incorporated into statutes and regulations governing the investing authority of most state banks, and thus most state banks are required to adhere to these same investment grade standards. The primary regulator of national banks (the OCC) revised its regulatory definition of “investment grade” to require a bank’s determination regarding whether “the issuer of a security has adequate capacity to meet financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the asset or exposure.” While national banks may continue to consider credit ratings, they may not rely exclusively on such ratings and must conduct separate due diligence to confirm the investment grade of the instruments. Likewise, the federal banking regulators adopted amendments to the market risk capital rules to reflect the appropriate capital treatment of debt and securitization positions without reliance on the credit ratings assigned to those instruments. These developments may limit the ability or willingness of national banks to purchase Certificates, especially any Certificates that have not been assigned a credit rating, which in turn may adversely affect the liquidity of the Certificates in the secondary market. This could adversely affect your ability to transfer Certificates or the price you may receive upon your sale of Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">In connection with agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“<b>BCBS</b>”) in revising the risk-based capital and leverage requirements set forth in Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems, including subsequent amendments and consultative papers (together, “<b>Basel III</b>”), the federal banking agencies recently adopted revisions to the general risk-based capital and leverage guidelines applicable to U.S.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">banking organizations. The changes to these guidelines generally will cause exposures to RMBS held by U.S. banking organizations to be calculated in a different manner, and in some cases to become subject to risk weights that are higher and, for more subordinated classes of securities, substantially higher, or otherwise may adversely affect the treatment of RMBS for regulatory capital purposes. This and other changes adopted may limit the ability or willingness of banks to purchase RMBS, which in turn may adversely affect the liquidity of the Certificates in the secondary market. This could adversely affect your ability to transfer Certificates or the price you may receive upon your sale of Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently adopted changes to the accounting standards for structured products such as the Certificates. These changes, or any future changes, may affect the manner in which you must account for your investment in any Certificates and, under some circumstances, may require that you consolidate the entire Issuing Entity on your balance sheet. Prospective investors in the Certificates should consult their accounting advisors to determine the effect that accounting standards, including the recent changes, may have on them. The imposition of these standards could affect the ability or willingness of various entities to purchase Certificates, which in turn may adversely affect the liquidity of the Certificates in the secondary market. This could adversely affect your ability to transfer Certificates or the price you may receive upon your sale of Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, future statutory or regulatory developments may further limit the ability or desire of investors in the Certificates to resell their Certificates in the secondary market. Accordingly, all prospective investors in the Certificates should consider the possible effects of legal investment, regulatory capital, accounting and other restrictions and requirements on the liquidity and value of their Certificates, whether or not those requirements and restrictions would apply in connection with their initial investments in the Certificates or to other investors or potential investors in mortgage-backed securities. In any event, all prospective investors whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Certificates will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other restrictions, unfavorable accounting treatment, reporting requirements, due diligence requirements, capital charges or reserve requirements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Risks Relating to Partnership Audit Rules</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Partnerships, their partners and the persons that are authorized to represent entities treated as partnerships are subject to certain partnership audit rules in IRS audits and related procedures. These rules also apply to new and existing REMICs, the holders of REMIC residual interests and the trustees or administrators authorized to represent REMICs in IRS audits and related procedures. Under these rules, unless a REMIC elects otherwise, taxes arising from IRS audit adjustments are required to be paid by the REMIC rather than by its residual interest holders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Paying Agent will have the authority to utilize, and will be directed to utilize, any exceptions available under the partnership audit rules and related Treasury regulations so that the Class R Certificates, to the fullest extent possible, rather than any REMIC, will be liable for any taxes arising from audit adjustments to the REMIC’s taxable income. It is not entirely clear how any such elections may affect the procedural rules available to challenge any audit adjustment that would otherwise be available in the absence of any such elections. Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible effect of these rules on them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Governmental Intervention, Financial Regulatory Reforms and Proposed Regulations Could Have a Significant Impact on the Sponsor, the Seller, the Depositor, the Issuing Entity, the Originators, the Servicing Administrator, the Servicer, the Master Servicer or on the Value or Marketability of the Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Disruptions in the global financial markets in recent years have led to extensive and unprecedented governmental intervention. Such intervention was in certain cases implemented on an expedited basis, suddenly and substantially eliminating market participants’ ability to continue to implement certain strategies or manage the risk of their outstanding positions. In addition, these interventions often have been unclear in scope and application, resulting in confusion and uncertainty which in itself has been materially detrimental to the efficient functioning of the markets as well as previously successful investment strategies.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Recent legislative initiatives and completed and pending regulatory implementation and any uncertainty about the nature and timing of the regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act and related implementing regulations and recently-adopted and proposed amendments to Regulation AB, may create uncertainty in the credit and other financial markets. Such uncertainty may affect the performance of the transaction parties and may adversely affect the value or marketability of the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Dodd-Frank Act and Regulatory Implementation<span class="p">. Recent changes in federal banking and securities laws, including those resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act enacted in the United States, may have an adverse effect on issuers, investors, or other participants in the asset-backed securities markets (including RMBS). In particular, new capital regulations were issued by the U.S. banking regulators in July 2013; these regulations implement the increased capital requirements established under the Basel Accord and are being phased in over time. These new capital regulations eliminate reliance on credit ratings and otherwise alter, and in most cases increase, the capital requirements imposed on depository institutions and their holding companies, including with respect to ownership of asset backed securities. Further changes in capital requirements have been announced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and it is uncertain when such changes will be implemented in the United States. When fully implemented in the United States, these changes may have an adverse effect with respect to investments in asset-backed securities (including RMBS).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits lenders from originating residential mortgage loans unless the lender forms an opinion that the mortgagor has a reasonable ability to repay the loan. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a lender and its assignees will not have liability under this prohibition with respect to any Qualified Mortgage. Qualified Mortgages are either (a) Safe Harbor Mortgage Loans entitled to the benefit of a safe harbor from such liability or (b) Rebuttable Presumption Mortgage Loans entitled to the benefit of a rebuttable presumption from such liability. Mortgage loans originated in violation of TILA may expose subsequent purchasers of such mortgage loans to liability in respect of such violations. One of the Mortgage Loans is a Safe Harbor Mortgage Loan and none of the Mortgage Loans are Rebuttable Presumption Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Dodd-Frank Act also revises and adds sections to TILA and RESPA that impose a number of additional requirements for originators and servicers of residential mortgage loans and increase the penalties for noncompliance with those laws. The CFPB implemented rules that became effective for mortgage loans originated on or after January 10, 2014 that, among other things, require servicers to provide information to mortgagors about loss mitigation options (including as an alternative to foreclosure) and to implement procedures for evaluating and responding to loss mitigation requests. These rules were amended on June 28, 2021 to provide additional assistance to mortgagors experiencing COVID-19-related difficulties and may result in increased loan modification activity, and may extend foreclosure timelines or otherwise extend the process of loss mitigation, any of which could lead to delays in collections and distributions on your Certificates, and increased losses. See “—<i>The COVID-19 Outbreak May Adversely Affect the Performance, Liquidity and Market Value of the Offered Certificates</i>” for more information about these recent changes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Issuing Entity is being structured so as not to constitute a “covered fund” for purposes of the regulations adopted to implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (such statutory provision together with such implementing regulations, the “<b>Volcker Rule</b>”). The Volcker Rule generally prohibits “banking entities” (which is broadly defined to include U.S. banks and bank holding companies and many non-U.S. banking entities, together with their respective subsidiaries and other affiliates) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading, (ii) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a “covered fund.” and (iii) entering into certain relationships with such funds. The Volcker Rule became effective on July 21, 2012, and final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule were adopted on December 10, 2013. Banking entities are required to be in conformance with the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015, although ownership interests or sponsorships in covered funds in existence prior to December 31, 2013 were not required to be brought into conformance until July 21, 2017 (with the possibility of an additional five-year extension for certain illiquid funds). Under the Volcker Rule, unless otherwise jointly determined by specified federal regulators, a “covered fund” does not include an issuer that may rely on an exclusion or exemption from the definition of “investment company” under the Investment Company Act other than the exclusions contained in Section 3(c)(1) and Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. The general effects of the Volcker Rule remain uncertain. Any prospective investor in the Certificates, including a U.S. or foreign bank or a subsidiary or other affiliate thereof, should consult its own legal advisors regarding such matters and other effects of the Volcker Rule.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are required to be implemented through rulemaking by the applicable federal regulatory agencies, and much of this rulemaking has yet to occur. In addition, Section 1022(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFPB to conduct an assessment of each rule within five years of its adoption.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The results of any such assessments could result in changes to existing rules and further rulemaking. Therefore, the full impact of financial regulatory reform on the financial markets and its participants and on the asset-backed securities market in particular will not be known for some time. No assurance can be given that the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, or the imposition of additional regulations, will not have a significant adverse impact on the value of the Certificates, on the servicing of the Mortgage Loans or on the Sponsor, the Seller, the Depositor, the Issuing Entity, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Originators, the Representation Provider, the Servicer, the Master Servicer or the Servicing Administrator.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Amendments to Regulation AB<span class="p">. In August 2014, the SEC adopted rules that substantially revise Regulation AB and other rules governing the offering process, disclosure and reporting for asset-backed securities issued in registered transactions. Among other things, the changes will require enhanced disclosure of asset-level information at the time of the securitization and on an ongoing basis. Revised Regulation AB introduces new shelf eligibility requirements for depositors, including a requirement that the chief executive officer of the depositor or the chief executive officer in charge of securitization for the depositor deliver a certification with respect to the prospectus and the transaction structure. As required under Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act, the new shelf eligibility requirements remove any reliance on investment-grade credit ratings. No assurance can be given that the newly-adopted standards will not be applied by other issuing entities of RMBS relying on the Rule 144A safe harbor, and, if so, what effect (if any) any such issuance will have on the value or marketability of the Certificates. Neither this Offering Memorandum nor the provisions of the transaction documents will be compliant with the provision of Regulation AB. Such non-compliance may adversely affect the market values of the Certificates.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certain elements of proposed Regulation AB remain outstanding, including the proposal conditioning reliance by issuers of structured finance products (including RMBS) on the Rule 144A and Rule 506 safe harbors on the inclusion of provisions in the transaction documents requiring an issuer to provide, and represent that it will provide, on request, the same initial and ongoing information (including asset-level information) as would be required if the offering were a registered offering. It is not clear when or whether any of the proposed revisions to Regulation AB that remain outstanding will be adopted or how those standards will be implemented, what effect those standards will have on securitization transactions and to what extent the Sponsor, the Seller, the Depositor, the Issuing Entity, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Originators, the Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Servicing Administrator or the Representation Provider will be affected. No assurance can be given that the proposed standards, if implemented, will not apply to this transaction or have an adverse impact on the value or marketability of the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">On October 21, 2014, the FDIC, the FHFA and the OCC adopted a final rule implementing the credit risk retention requirements of section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act for asset-backed securities (the “<b>U.S. Risk Retention Rules</b>”). The following day, the Federal Reserve, the SEC and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (together with the FDIC, FHFA, and OCC, the “<b>Joint Regulators</b>”) adopted the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require “securitizers” to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the mortgage loans securitized and generally prohibit securitizers from directly or indirectly eliminating or reducing its credit exposure by hedging or otherwise transferring the credit risk that the securitizer is required to retain. In accordance with U.S. Risk Retention Rules, as of the Closing Date, the Sponsor will own the U.S. Risk Retention Certificates, which equal not less than 5% of the fair value of the Certificates (excluding any non-economic REMIC residual interest). See “<i>U.S. Risk Retention</i>” in this Offering Memorandum. At this time, it is unclear what effect a failure of the Sponsor to be in compliance with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules at any time will have on the market value or liquidity of the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, other regulatory agencies, including the FDIC, recently have proposed or adopted financial reform regulations. It is not clear whether or when any proposed regulations will be adopted, what the final form of any such regulations will be, how they will be implemented, or if the Issuing Entity, the Depositor, the Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Servicing Administrator or any successor servicer will be affected. No assurance can be given that any proposed regulations will not have an adverse impact on the Issuing Entity, the Depositor, the Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Servicing Administrator or any successor servicer or on the market value of your Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Prospective investors should also independently assess and determine whether they are directly or indirectly subject to market risk capital rules jointly promulgated by the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC that became effective on January 1, 2013. Any prospective investor that is subject to these rules should independently assess and determine its ability to comply with the regulatory capital treatment and reporting requirements that may be required with respect to the purchase of an Offered Certificate and what impact any</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">such regulatory capital treatment and reporting requirements may have on the liquidity or market value of your Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certificateholders will bear the risk that future regulatory and legal developments will result in losses on their Certificates, to the extent not covered by the applicable credit enhancement. The effect on the Offered Certificates will be likely more severe if any of these future legal and regulatory developments occur in one or more states in which there is a significant concentration of Mortgaged Properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In general, compliance with applicable law and regulations may be costly because new processes, forms, controls and additional infrastructure may be required to comply with new requirements. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Offered Certificates May Not Be Suitable for Investment by Certain EU and United Kingdom Regulated Investors and Affiliates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">EU legislation comprising Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 (the “<b>EU Securitization Regulation</b>,” and together with all related regulatory and/or implementing technical standards and official guidance published in relation thereto, the “<b>EU Securitization Rules</b>”) has direct effect in member States of the EU and is expected to be implemented by national legislation in the non-EU member states of the European Economic Area.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The EU Securitization Regulation became part of the laws of the United Kingdom under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “<b>EUWA</b>”), subject to the amendments in the Securitisation (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the “<b>UK Securitization Regulation</b>” and, together with all related regulatory and/or implementing technical standards and official guidance published in relation thereto, the “<b>UK Securitization Rules</b>”).

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, among other changes, includes a reduction of the home mortgage interest deduction threshold and a limitation on the deduction for state and local taxes, which could reduce home affordability and adversely affect home prices nationally or in local markets. Also, changes in the tax treatment of investor properties could materially affect mortgagors. In addition, such changes could increase taxes payable by certain mortgagors, thereby reducing their available cash and adversely impacting their ability to make payments on the Mortgage Loans, which in turn, could cause a loss on the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be issued, the impact of those on the housing market or the holders of the Offered Certificates or the long-term impact of recently-enacted tax reforms.

In addition, on April 18, 2013, Fitch downgraded the long-term credit ratings on the United Kingdom, and on October 10, 2014, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded the long-term credit ratings on Finland.

Although Brexit is complete, there is still uncertainty as to the scope, nature and terms of the relationship between the UK and the EU after Brexit. While the UK and the EU have reached an agreement (the “<b>EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement</b>”) on the principles to govern certain aspects of their future trade relationship, there continues to be uncertainty as to the scope, nature and terms of the relationship between the UK and the EU after Brexit. Brexit, the interpretation and implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and other aspects of the relationship between the UK and the EU such as financial services, which aspects are not addressed in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, are likely to lead to legal uncertainty and divergent national laws and regulations, which could adversely affect economic and market conditions in the UK, in the EU and its member states and the global financial markets.

In particular, Brexit could significantly impact volatility, liquidity and/or the market value of securities, including the Offered Certificates. An investment in the Certificates should only be made by investors who understand such risks and are capable of bearing such risks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Changes in the Market Value of the Certificates May Not Be Reflective of the Performance or Anticipated Performance of the Mortgage Loans Underlying the Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The market value of the Certificates can be volatile. Market values can change rapidly and significantly and changes can result from a variety of factors. However, a decrease in market value may not necessarily be the result of deterioration in the performance or anticipated performance of the Mortgage Loans. For example, changes in interest rates, perceived risk, supply and demand for similar or other investment products, accounting</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">standards, capital requirements that apply to regulated financial institutions, and other factors that are not directly related to the Mortgage Loans can adversely and materially affect the market value of the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In particular, the market value of the Offered Certificates may decline as a result of changes in interest rates. The Mortgage Loans have fixed or adjustable Mortgage Interest Rates. The Certificate Rates on the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class M-1 and Class B-1 Certificates are fixed, subject to the Net WAC Rate. As a result, in the event the general level of interest rates increases, the value of the Offered Certificates may decline. In addition, the weighted average lives of the Offered Certificates may be extended, as an increase in the general level of interest rates, to the extent mortgage rates also increase, may act as a disincentive to the refinancing of the Mortgage Loans by the mortgagors or their ability to sell their homes or to move to a new location. In addition, an increase in interest rates, to the extent mortgage rates also increase, may result in a decrease in the value of Mortgaged Properties generally. There can be no assurance that the current level of interest rates will be stable. The rate of any change may be rapid and may adversely affect the value of the Offered Certificates, even in the absence of losses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Rate of Principal Payments, Including Principal Prepayments, on the Mortgage Loans Will Affect the Yields on the Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The rate of distributions of principal and the yields to maturity on the Certificates will be directly related to, among other things, (i) the rate and timing of scheduled payments of principal and principal prepayments on the Mortgage Loans, including voluntary prepayments on the Mortgage Loans and any other recovery of principal in advance of the scheduled Due Date, such as payments received in connection with the repurchase of a Mortgage Loan and payments received in connection with Mortgage Loan liquidations due to default, casualty, condemnation or otherwise and (ii) the amount and timing of defaults by mortgagors that result in losses on the Mortgage Loans. As of the Cut-off Date, approximately 84.54% of the Mortgage Loans by Scheduled Principal Balance as of the Cut-Off Date may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without payment of a prepayment penalty. The principal payments on the Mortgage Loans may be in the form of scheduled principal payments or principal prepayments. Any of these prepayments will result in distributions to you of amounts that would otherwise be distributed over the remaining term of the Mortgage Loans. You must make your own decisions as to the appropriate prepayment and default assumptions to be used when purchasing Certificates.

If prevailing interest rates for similar mortgage loans fall below the interest rates on the Mortgage Loans, the rate of prepayment is likely to increase. Conversely, if prevailing interest rates for similar mortgage loans rise above the Mortgage Interest Rates on the Mortgage Loans, the rate of prepayment is likely to decrease. In general, a contraction of the availability of or an increase in the cost of credit may decrease refinancing activity, which would be expected to decrease the rate of prepayment even if interest rates are comparably low. However, the expansion of credit could result in an increase in refinancing activity even in a rising interest rate environment if credit standards are relaxed and underwriting guidelines expanded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">No representation is made as to the rate of principal payments, including principal prepayments, on the Mortgage Loans or as to the yield to maturity of any class of Certificates. In addition, there can be no assurance that any of the Mortgage Loans will or will not be prepaid prior to maturity. An investor is urged to make an investment decision with respect to any class of Certificates based on the anticipated yield to maturity of that class of Certificates resulting from its purchase price and the investor’s own determination as to anticipated mortgage loan prepayment and default rates under a variety of scenarios. The extent to which any class of Certificates is purchased at a discount or a premium and the degree to which the timing of distributions on the class of Certificates is impacted by prepayments will determine the extent to which the yield to maturity of the class of Certificates may vary from the anticipated yields.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If you are purchasing P&amp;I Certificates at a discount, you should consider the risk that if principal payments on the applicable Mortgage Loans occur at a rate slower than you expected, your yield will be lower than you expected. If you are purchasing P&amp;I Certificates at a premium (or if you are purchasing the Class A-IO- S Certificates) you should consider the risk that if principal payments on the Mortgage Loans occur at a rate faster than you expected, your yield may be lower than you expected. See “<i>Yield, Prepayment and Weighted Average Life</i>” in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Because the Certificate Rates of the Offered Certificates are limited by the Net WAC Rate, the Offered Certificates could be adversely affected if the Mortgage Loans having relatively high Mortgage Interest Rates experienced a faster rate of principal payments than the Mortgage Loans having relatively low Mortgage Interest Rates. The Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class M-1 and Class B-1 Certificates are entitled to receive Cap Carryover Amounts to the extent of Monthly Excess Cashflow available therefor as described in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If you are purchasing Class B-X Certificates, which are the most subordinated class of Certificates, in addition to the negative effect on the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution of a rapid rate of prepayments, the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution is also extremely sensitive to unscheduled recoveries of principal, including Liquidation Proceeds, as the distribution priorities allocate Monthly Excess Cashflow that would otherwise be distributed as the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution instead to make distributions on the P&amp;I Certificates (including on the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class B-X Certificates), up to the amount of Realized Losses during the related Prepayment Period and Applied Realized Loss Amounts allocated on prior Distribution Dates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The timing of changes in the rate of prepayments may significantly affect the actual yield to you, even if the average rate of principal prepayments is consistent with your expectations. In general, the earlier the payment of principal of the Mortgage Loans, the greater the effect on your yield to maturity. As a result, the effect on your yield of principal prepayments occurring at a rate higher (or lower) than the rate you anticipate during the period immediately following the issuance of the Certificates may not be offset by a subsequent like reduction (or increase) in the rate of principal prepayments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Net WAC Rate May Limit the Certificate Rates of the Offered Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The application of the Net WAC Rate may cause the Certificate Rates of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class M-1 and Class B-1 Certificates to be less than the applicable fixed rate set forth in the Certificates</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tables. The Certificate Rates for the Class B-2 and Class B-X Certificates are equal to the Net WAC Rate. The Net WAC Rate may decrease with respect to the adjustable rate Mortgage Loans as a result of, among other factors, the dates of adjustment, the gross margins and changes in the applicable indices. In addition, even if LIBOR or SOFR increases, a maximum mortgage interest rate or a periodic cap may limit the Mortgage Interest Rate, which could adversely affect the yields on the Offered Certificates. The Net WAC Rate will also decrease if the Mortgage Loans with relatively high Mortgage Interest Rates prepay at a faster rate than the Mortgage Loans with relatively low Mortgage Interest Rates or if Mortgage Loans are modified to reduce their Mortgage Interest Rates (in response to the COVID-19 outbreak or otherwise), increasing the likelihood that the Net WAC Rate will apply to limit the Certificate Rates of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class M-1 and Class B-1 Certificates. In addition, a reduction in the Net WAC Rate for any Distribution Date will reduce the amount of interest distributable to the Class B-2 and Class B-X Certificates (and the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution) on such Distribution Date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Net Interest Shortfalls Resulting from Principal Prepayments and the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and Similar State Laws Will Reduce Distributions of Interest on the Offered Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">When a voluntary principal prepayment is made by the mortgagor on a Mortgage Loan (excluding any payments made upon liquidation of any Mortgage Loan), the mortgagor is charged interest only up to the date of the prepayment, instead of for a full month. However, principal prepayments will only be passed through to the Certificateholders once a month on the Distribution Date that follows the Prepayment Period in which the prepayment was received by the Servicer. In the event the timing of any voluntary prepayments in full on the Mortgage Loans would cause there to be less than one full month’s interest at the applicable Mortgage Interest Rates that is available to be distributed to Certificateholders with respect to the prepaid Mortgage Loans, Compensating Interest Payments will be deducted from the Gross Administration Fee in an amount equal to the amount by which the Prepayment Interest Shortfall related to such Mortgage Loans, if any, for such Distribution Date exceeds the Prepayment Interest Excess for the Mortgage Loans and such Distribution Date (excluding any payments made upon liquidation of such Mortgage Loans) but only to the extent the aggregate amount of those shortfalls do not exceed 1/12th of 0.25% multiplied by the aggregate Scheduled Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the first day of the related Due Period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Net Interest Shortfalls may result from reductions in the amount of the monthly interest payment on a Mortgage Loan due to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and similar state laws (the “<b>Relief Act</b>”) or to the extent Compensating Interest Payments are not made. Net Interest Shortfalls will be allocated to the P&amp;I Certificates on each Distribution Date, <i>pro rata</i>, based on the Current Interest for each such class of Certificates for such Distribution Date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, no such payments from any party will be available to cover Prepayment Interest Shortfalls resulting from Partial Prepayments or involuntary prepayments such as the liquidation of a defaulted Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Shortfalls in interest resulting from the foregoing factors may result in a reduction of the yield on your Certificates.

The Pooling and Servicing Agreement requires any successor servicer to be (i) an established housing and home finance institution, bank or other mortgage loan or equity loan servicer having a net worth of not less than $15,000,000 and reasonably acceptable to the Controlling Representative, (ii) capable of assuming all of the responsibilities, duties and obligations of the Servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and (iii) a Fannie Mae-approved lender or a Freddie Mac approved seller/servicer in good standing, and with respect to which no event has occurred which would make it unable to comply with the eligibility requirements for lenders imposed by Fannie Mae or for seller/servicers imposed by Freddie Mac. There can be no assurance that a successor servicer meeting these requirements will be available and there may be delays in the transfer of servicing to a successor servicer. The Master Servicer, the Servicing Administrator, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the successor servicer will be entitled to reimbursement from the predecessor servicer for its costs of effecting the servicing transfer or from the assets of the Issuing Entity if the predecessor fails to pay. In the event that reimbursement to the Master Servicer, the Servicing Administrator, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the successor servicer is made from assets of the Issuing Entity, that reimbursement will be made prior to distributions on the Certificates (and will not be subject to any expense cap), and the resulting shortfall will be borne by the Certificateholders. The COVID-19 outbreak and resulting liquidity pressures on the Servicer could also increase the likelihood of a default as a result of the Servicer’s failure to make a P&amp;I Advance. There can be no assurance that the Servicer has the requisite financial resources to make such P&amp;I Advances.

The Servicing Fee is paid prior to distributions on the Certificates and any increase in the Servicing Fee in excess of that permitted to the Servicer may result in decreased distributions to one or more classes of Certificates. Any increase in the Servicing Fee would reduce and could eliminate interest distributions to the Class A-IO-S Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In August 2014, the CFPB issued a compliance bulletin and policy guidance advising servicers that the CFPB will be carefully reviewing servicers’ compliance with federal consumer financial laws applicable to servicing transfers, and that servicers should expect that the CFPB will, in appropriate cases, require servicers to prepare and submit informational plans describing how they will be managing the related risks to consumers. The failure of the Servicer or any successor servicer to comply with CFPB guidance or any laws and regulations applicable to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans may result in delays in the collection of payments or realization of proceeds on the Mortgage Loans, any of which may adversely affect the yields on the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Limited Source of Distributions—No Recourse to the Sponsor, the Seller, the Depositor, the Originators, the Servicer, the Servicing Administrator, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Master Servicer or the Initial Purchasers</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Mortgage Loans will be the sole source of distributions on the Certificates.

You should consider that, if you buy a Certificate and losses on the Mortgage Loans exceed the aggregate Certificate Principal Balance of the Certificates with a lower priority of principal distribution, you may not receive the full Certificate Principal Balance of your Certificates.

If a Mortgaged Property fails to provide adequate security for the related Mortgage Loan, you could incur a loss on your investment if the applicable credit enhancement is insufficient to cover the loss.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investors Have No Direct Right to Enforce Remedies</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Except with respect to the right of Certificateholders to initiate a Certificateholder Review Trigger as described under “<i>Mortgage Loan Representations and Warranties—The Review Process,</i>” Certificateholders generally do not have the right to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, but instead must rely on the Trustee to enforce their rights under these agreements. If the Trustee is not required or does not have the right to take action under the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or if the Trustee, on behalf of the Issuing Entity, fails to take action, Certificateholders could experience losses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides that the Trustee will take direction as to certain matters from the Servicing Administrator in some cases, and from the Controlling Representative in others.

In addition, the Representation and Warranty Reviewer’s review, together with any related arbitration proceeding, will be the sole method to determine whether any breach of a representation or warranty made by the Representation Provider occurred with respect to a Mortgage Loan that would trigger a non-discretionary repurchase, indemnity or substitution obligation, and judicial review of that determination is not permitted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certificateholders will have no right to institute any proceeding against the Representation and Warranty Reviewer arising out of or relating in any way to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or the services, acts or omissions of the Representation and Warranty Reviewer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Certificateholders Have Limited Control over Amendments, Modifications and Waivers to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certain amendments, modifications or waivers to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement do not require the consent of any Certificateholder.

If a transaction party becomes subject to litigation or governmental proceedings in connection with its residential mortgage business, the Mortgage Loans or the Mortgaged Properties, this may increase the costs and expenses of the Issuing Entity, the Master Servicer, the Servicer, the Servicing Administrator, the Representation Provider, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar and the Custodian. Such costs and expenses are generally paid prior to distributions on the Certificates. In addition, if the Servicer is subject to litigation or governmental proceedings, this may affect the ability of the Servicer to perform its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (including making required P&amp;I Advances and Servicing Advances), even if such litigation is not related to the Issuing Entity or the Mortgage Loans. If the Representation Provider becomes subject to litigation or a governmental proceeding, this may affect the ability of the Representation Provider to perform its obligations to repurchase Mortgage Loans from the Issuing Entity (or, with respect to Liquidated Loans, make an indemnity payment) with respect to which there has been a Material Breach of representations and warranties and satisfaction of the conditions to repurchase (or indemnity). This could result in a delay in or reduction of distributions on the Certificates. If the Servicing Administrator becomes subject to litigation or governmental proceedings, this may affect its ability to perform its obligations to make certain Servicing Advances and P&amp;I Advances in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. This could result in a delay in or reduction of distributions on the Certificates. If the Master Servicer becomes subject to litigation or governmental proceedings, this may affect the ability of the Master Servicer to assume the duties of the Servicer and the Servicing Administrator under certain circumstances as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. No assurances can be made as to the effect any such litigation or governmental proceedings may have on the value of, or distributions on, the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Financial Difficulties May Impact the Return on the Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The financial difficulties of originators, servicers and subservicers of residential mortgage loans may be exacerbated by higher delinquencies and defaults that reduce the value of mortgage loan portfolios, requiring originators to sell their portfolios at greater discounts to par. The value of many residual interests retained by sellers of mortgage loans in the securitization market has also been declining in these market conditions. Overall origination volumes are down significantly from peak volume, particularly for non-Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage products. Many originators and aggregators that also have large servicing portfolios have experienced rising costs of servicing as mortgage loan delinquencies have increased, without an increase in servicing compensation. In addition, any regulatory oversight, proposed legislation and/or governmental intervention designed to protect consumers may have an adverse impact on originators and servicers. These factors, among others, may have the overall effect of increasing costs and expenses of originators, servicers and subservicers while at the same time decreasing servicing cash flow and loan origination revenues. Financial difficulties may result in the inability of representing parties to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of loan representation and warranty breaches or, as described below, to make required advances of delinquent monthly payments which may also affect the value of RMBS backed by those mortgage loans, including the Certificates. Financial difficulties may also have a negative effect on the ability of servicers and subservicers to pursue</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">collections on mortgage loans that are experiencing increased delinquencies and defaults and to maximize recoveries on the sale of underlying properties following foreclosure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Servicer is obligated to make Servicing Advances and P&amp;I Advances under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. If the Servicer experiences financial difficulties, it may not be able to perform its advancing obligations. Due to application of provisions of bankruptcy law, if the Servicer were to seek bankruptcy protection, it may not be relieved of its obligation to make P&amp;I Advances to the Issuing Entity. If the Servicer does not fulfill the obligation to make P&amp;I Advances for whatever reason, the timing and amount of payments available for distribution to the Certificateholders will be affected. Furthermore, the Servicer may not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, including its obligations to make P&amp;I Advances and Servicing Advances. Limited financial resources may result in a delay or failure in making P&amp;I Advances and Servicing Advances. There is no guarantee that the Servicer will have adequate financial resources in the future. There can be no assurance that the Servicer has, or will have in the future, the requisite financial resources to comply with its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting economic disruption may result in liquidity pressures on the Servicer and any other party on which the Servicer may rely for funding of P&amp;I Advances and Servicing Advances. In addition, the imposition by federal and state regulators of forbearance arrangements on servicers can also be expected to affect the capacity of the Servicer to make P&amp;I Advances and Servicing Advances as required by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, although the extent of all liquidity pressures in the future is not known at this time and is subject to continual change. See “<i>—The COVID-19 Outbreak May Adversely Affect the Performance, Liquidity and Market Value of the Offered Certificates</i>” in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If the Servicer experiences financial difficulties (as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak or otherwise), it may not be able to perform its servicing duties. Furthermore, an increased level of delinquencies in mortgage loans serviced by the Servicer may result in delays in foreclosure proceedings on the Mortgage Loans. In response to these circumstances, federal, state and local authorities have enacted and continue to propose new legislation, rules and regulations relating to the origination, servicing and treatment of mortgage loans in default or in bankruptcy. These initiatives could result in delayed or reduced collections from mortgagors, limitations on the foreclosure process and generally increased servicing costs. Certain of these initiatives could also permit the Servicer to take actions (subject to the conditions set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement), including modification of mortgage loans, that might adversely affect the Certificates without any remedy or compensation to the holders of the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">There is no assurance that the Servicer will not resign (or, following an event of default in respect of the Servicer, will not be terminated) as the servicer of the Mortgage Loans, and the cost of replacing the Servicer may adversely affect the Certificates. The replacement of the Servicer may also adversely affect the future performance of the related Mortgage Loans. See <i>“—Servicing Transfers May Result in Decreased or Delayed Collections and Losses</i>” in this Offering Memorandum. From time to time, investors in securities similar to the Certificates may have alleged that a particular servicer may not have serviced mortgage loans properly in a securitization vehicle similar to the Issuing Entity. No assurance can be given that such allegations have not been made against the Servicer or will not be made against the Servicer in the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Paying Agent and the Certificate Registrar Have Recently Come Under New Ownership, Which May Result in Service Disruptions</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">As described under “<i>The Master Servicer</i>” and “<i>The Paying Agent and Certificate Registrar</i>” herein, Wells Fargo &amp; Company sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services (“<b>CTS</b>”) business to Computershare Limited on November 1, 2021, and virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo Bank, along with most existing CTS systems, technology and offices, transferred to Computershare Trust Company or CDTC, as applicable, as part of the sale. On November 1, 2021, for some of the transactions in its CTS business, Wells Fargo Bank transferred its roles, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant transaction agreements to Computershare Trust Company. For other transactions in its CTS business, Wells Fargo Bank intends to transfer such roles, duties, rights, and liabilities to Computershare Trust Company or Computershare Delaware Trust Company (“<b>CDTC</b>”), as applicable, in stages after November 1, 2021. For any transaction where Wells Fargo Bank’s roles did not transfer to Computershare Trust Company or CDTC on November 1, 2021, Computershare Trust Company or CDTC performs all or virtually all of Wells Fargo Bank’s obligations as its agent as of such date. No assurances can be given regarding any potential impact that any such transfer to Computershare Trust Company or CDTC may have on the AOMT 2021-8 transaction or the performance of the Master Servicer, Paying Agent or Certificate Registrar under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bankruptcy or Insolvency of the Servicer Could Result in Losses on the Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Servicer will be permitted to commingle collections on the Mortgage Loans with funds collected by it for its own benefit or the benefit of another person for up to two business days. In addition, the Servicer will deposit collections in an account that is not under the control of the Issuing Entity, and collections will be held in this account before they are remitted each month to the Master Servicer. In addition, to the extent that the Servicer has commingled collections of Mortgage Loans with its own funds, the holders of the Certificates may be required to return to the Servicer certain distributions received on the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If the Servicer were to go into bankruptcy or become the subject of a receivership or conservatorship, then the parties may be prohibited (unless authorization is obtained from the court or the receiver or conservator) from taking any action to enforce any obligations of the Servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or to collect any amount owing by the Servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and the parties may be prohibited from terminating the Servicer and appointing a successor servicer. If the Servicer were to become a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “<b>Bankruptcy Code</b>”), the Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides that such an event would be an event of default entitling the Servicing Administrator (or, at the direction of the Controlling Representative, requiring), to terminate the Servicer, but the provision would most likely not be enforceable. However, a rejection of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by the Servicer in a bankruptcy proceeding would be treated as a breach of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and give the Issuing Entity a claim for damages and the ability to appoint a successor servicer. An assumption under the Bankruptcy Code would require the Servicer to cure its pre-bankruptcy defaults, if any, and demonstrate that it is able to perform following assumption. The bankruptcy court may permit the Servicer to assume the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and assign it to a third party. An insolvency by an entity governed by state insolvency law would vary depending on the laws of the particular state. We cannot assure you that a bankruptcy or receivership of the Servicer would not adversely impact the servicing of the Mortgage Loans or the Issuing Entity would be entitled to terminate the Servicer in a timely manner or at all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">It is possible that a period of adverse economic conditions (including as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak) resulting in high defaults and delinquencies on the Mortgage Loans and other mortgage loans serviced by the Servicer will increase the risk of the Servicer becoming subject to bankruptcy or receivership proceedings if its servicing compensation is less than its cost of servicing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The occurrence of any of these events could result in delays or reductions in distributions on, or other losses with respect to, the Certificates. There may also be other possible effects of a bankruptcy, receivership or conservatorship of the Servicer that could result in delays or reductions in distributions on, or other losses with respect to, the Certificates. Regardless of any specific adverse determinations in a bankruptcy, receivership or conservatorship of the Servicer, the fact that such a proceeding has been commenced could have an adverse effect on the value of the Mortgage Loans and the liquidity and value of the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Financial Condition of the Representation Provider</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">There can be no assurance that the Representation Provider will have the financial ability to repurchase or substitute any Mortgage Loan, or indemnify the Issuing Entity for any losses in respect of any Liquidated Loan, for which a Material Breach, a TRID violation or an Early Payment Default has occurred.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Representation Provider was formed on October 25, 2010. The Representation Provider has limited assets that it can use to fund repurchases, substitutions or indemnifications. As of October 31, 2021, total members’ equity in AOHL is approximately $36,081,020. AOHL has total unrestricted cash, as of October 31, 2021, of approximately $3,841,295.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting economic disruption has resulted in liquidity pressures on mortgage loan originators and servicers. See “<i>The Originators—Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions LLC</i>” for more information regarding recent developments at Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions LLC, one of the Originators and an affiliate of the Representation Provider, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Although the Representation Provider primarily originates mortgage loans for the agency market, rather than the non-qualified mortgage market, there can be no assurance that the agency market will remain robust despite significant U.S. federal intervention. We are unable to predict the length and severity of the economic dislocation resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak and whether this may adversely affects the Representation Provider’s ability to fund repurchases, substitutions or indemnifications. See “—<i>The COVID-19 Outbreak May Adversely Affect the Performance, Liquidity and Market Value of the Offered Certificates</i>” in this Offering Memorandum. Investors</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">should make their own determination as the extent to which they place reliance on the financial condition of the Representation Provider.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If the Representation Provider fails to perform a specified remedy with respect to a Mortgage Loan with respect to which a Material Breach, a TRID rule violation or an Early Payment Default has occurred, the related Mortgage Loan will generally remain in the Issuing Entity and the Issuing Entity’s continued ownership of the Mortgage Loan may lead to greater Realized Losses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Developments in the Residential Mortgage Market May Adversely Affect the Performance and Market Value of Your Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Beginning in late 2006, delinquencies, defaults, modifications, foreclosures and losses with respect to residential mortgage loans increased significantly. The increase in delinquencies, defaults, modifications and foreclosures was not limited to “subprime” mortgage loans, which are made to mortgagors with weaker creditworthiness, but also affected “Alt-A” mortgage loans, which are made to mortgagors often with more limited documentation, and “prime” mortgage loans, which are made to mortgagors with better creditworthiness who often provide full documentation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Losses on all types of residential mortgage loans increased during the financial crisis that emerged in 2008 and the ensuing recession due to declines in residential real estate values, resulting in reduced home equity. Although home prices have increased in many geographic areas since the past recession, there can be no assurance that a decline will not resume and continue for an indefinite period of time in the future. A decline in property values or the failure of property values to increase where the outstanding balances of the Mortgage Loans and any secondary financing on the related Mortgaged Properties are close to or in excess of the value of the Mortgaged Properties may result in higher delinquencies, foreclosures and losses. Any decline in real estate values may be more severe for mortgage loans secured by high-value properties. Declining property values may create an oversupply of homes on the market, which may increase negative home equity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In response to increased delinquencies and losses with respect to mortgage loans, many residential mortgage loan originators implemented more conservative underwriting criteria for mortgage loans, which has resulted in reduced availability of financing alternatives for mortgagors seeking to refinance their mortgage loans. The reduced availability of refinancing options for mortgagors has resulted in slower rates of prepayments and higher rates of delinquencies and defaults and losses on mortgage loans, regardless of the creditworthiness of those mortgagors. The decline in housing values during the recession, and any future decline, may prevent mortgagors having insufficient equity in their homes from refinancing. Furthermore, mortgagors who intend to sell their homes on or before the maturity dates on their mortgage loans may find that they cannot sell their properties for an amount equal to or greater than the unpaid principal balance of their loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In response to some of the circumstances described above, federal, state and local authorities have enacted and continue to propose new legislation, rules and regulations relating to the origination, servicing and treatment of mortgage loans in default or in bankruptcy, including as described above under “—<i>Governmental Intervention, Financial Regulatory Reforms and Proposed Regulations Could Have a Significant Impact on the Sponsor, the Seller, the Depositor, the Issuing Entity, the Originators, the Servicing Administrator, the Servicer, the Master Servicer or on the Value or Marketability of the Certificates</i>.” These initiatives could result in delayed or reduced collections from mortgagors, limitations on the foreclosure process and generally increased servicing costs. Certain of these initiatives could also permit or require the Servicer to take actions, such as modification of Mortgage Loans, including the reduction of principal due on the Mortgage Loan, that might adversely affect the Certificates, without any remedy or compensation to the holders of the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in September 2008 have impacted both the real estate market and the value of real estate assets generally. While Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently act as the primary sources of liquidity in the residential mortgage markets, both by purchasing mortgage loans for their own portfolios and by guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities, their long-term role is uncertain as both the Trump administration and Congress have proposed reducing their role in the residential mortgage markets. On March 27, 2019, former President Trump issued a memorandum on federal housing finance reform and directed the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a plan for administrative and legislative reforms as soon as practicable to achieve housing reform goals that include the following: ending the conservatorships of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae; facilitating competition in the housing finance market; establishing regulation of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that safeguards their safety and soundness and minimizes the risks they pose to the financial stability of the United States; and providing that the federal government is properly compensated for any explicit or implicit</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">support it provides to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. On September 5, 2019, in response to the President’s memorandum, the Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development released plans detailing how such agencies believe the housing finance system should be reformed. The plans consist of a series of recommended legislative and administrative reforms to end the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while still guaranteeing support for single- and multi-family lending and affordable housing initiatives. On May 18, 2020, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced that they are seeking financial advisors to underwrite a public share offering. On May 21, 2020, the Federal Housing Finance Agency proposed regulations to support the GSEs’ exit from conservatorship by allowing them to increase their combined capital base from $45 billion to</p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$234 billion. The prospects for passage of any of these plans are uncertain, but the proposals underscore the potential for change to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A reduction in the ability of mortgage loan originators to access Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to sell their mortgage loans may adversely affect the mortgage markets generally and adversely affect the ability of mortgagors to refinance their mortgage loans. In addition, any decline in the value of securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may affect the value of RMBS in general and the Offered Certificates in particular.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">See also “—<i>The COVID-19 Outbreak May Adversely Affect the Performance, Liquidity and Market Value of the Offered Certificates</i>” in this Offering Memorandum for a discussion of the potential effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on the residential mortgage market.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Original Loan-to-Value Ratios Are Calculated Based on Appraised Value or Sales Price, Which May Not Be an Accurate Reflection of Current Market Value</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The original loan-to-value ratios that are disclosed in this Offering Memorandum are determined, in the case of a purchase money loan (except with respect to a lease purchase mortgage loan), based on the lesser of the purchase price of the Mortgaged Property and its Appraised Value determined in an appraisal obtained by the related Originator at origination of such Mortgage Loan, or, in the case of a refinanced mortgage loan or a lease purchase mortgage loan, based on the Appraised Value of the Mortgaged Property at the time of origination of such refinanced or lease purchase mortgage loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The appraisals obtained in connection with the origination of the Mortgage Loans sought to establish the amount a typically motivated buyer would pay a typically motivated seller at the time they were prepared. Such amount could be significantly higher than the amount obtained from the sale of a Mortgaged Property under a distressed or liquidation sale. In addition, in some real estate markets, property values may have declined since the time the appraisals were obtained. Therefore, the appraisals reflect an estimation of the value of the Mortgaged Properties at the time the Mortgage Loans were originated and may not be an accurate reflection of the current market value of the Mortgaged Properties. In addition, the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely affect home values which would not be represented in the appraisals because the appraisals were obtained prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In general, appraisals of the Mortgaged Properties represent the assessment and opinion of the person performing the appraisal at the time the appraisal is prepared and are not guarantees of, and may not be indicative of, present or future value. We cannot assure you that another person would not have arrived at a different, and perhaps, substantially different, valuation for any Mortgaged Property, even if such person used the same general approach to and same method of valuing the property, or that different valuations would not have been reached by the Sponsor based on its internal review of such appraisals. Investors should note that the COVID-19 outbreak has caused a significant economic downturn in the United States which could result in a devaluation of home prices, which in turn will have the effect of increasing loan-to-value ratios of the Mortgage Loans, and such home price devaluation could be significant. Investors are encouraged to make their own determination as to whether an appraisal is an accurate representation of the value of a Mortgaged Property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Prospective investors should consider that if an appraisal overestimates the prices at which Mortgaged Properties are actually sold, the proceeds of the related Mortgage Loans may be significantly less than anticipated by investors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Investors are encouraged to make their own determination as to the degree of reliance they place on the loan-to-value ratios that are disclosed in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Combined Loan-to-Value Ratios and the Subordinate Financing Statistics May Not Reflect the Presence or Amount of Other Mortgage Loans Secured by the Same Mortgaged Property</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The combined loan-to-value ratios and the subordinate financing statistics that are described in this Offering Memorandum are determined based on the amount of any known Mortgage Loan secured by a junior lien on the same Mortgaged Property. The combined loan-to-value ratio of any Mortgage Loan and the subordinate financing statistics will not reflect the presence or amount of any junior lien mortgage loans secured by the same Mortgaged Property if the related Originator does not have sufficient information to provide the relevant junior lien mortgage loan information. Such information may not be available, for example, if the related junior lien mortgage loan was made by a party other than the Originator or the related mortgage loan is a refinancing of an existing mortgage loan. None of the Depositor, the Initial Purchasers or any other party has conducted or will conduct any lien searches to determine if additional liens may exist on the Mortgaged Properties securing the Mortgage Loans. Accordingly, the combined loan-to-value ratios that are described in this Offering Memorandum may be lower, in some cases significantly lower, than the actual combined loan-to-value ratios that would be determined if junior lien mortgage loan information were known. Investors are encouraged to make their own determination as to the degree of reliance they place on the combined loan-to-value ratios and subordinate financing statistics that are described in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Delinquencies and Losses on the Mortgage Loans and Reimbursement of Advances May Adversely Affect Your Yield</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Servicer will be responsible for servicing the Mortgage Loans regardless of whether the Mortgage Loans are performing or have become delinquent or are otherwise in default. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and the significant effects it has had and is expected to have on the United States economy, it is likely that  certain  mortgagors will  have  difficulty  making Mortgage Loan  payments  due to  wage reductions or unemployment.  As delinquencies or defaults occur, the Servicer will be required to utilize an increasing amount of resources to work with mortgagors to maximize collections on the Mortgage Loans. At each step in the process of trying to bring a defaulted mortgage loan current or in maximizing proceeds, the Servicer will be required to invest time and resources not otherwise required when collecting payments on performing Mortgage Loans. Investors should note that in connection with considering a modification or other type of loss mitigation, the Servicer may incur or bear related out-of-pocket expenses, which would be reimbursed to the Servicer from the Issuing Entity prior to distributions on the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Servicer will not be required to make any P&amp;I Advances on Stop Advance Mortgage Loans. The Servicer will determine that a proposed advance is non-recoverable (and consequently, that the related Mortgage Loan is a Stop Advance Mortgage Loan) when, in its good faith judgment, it believes the proposed advance would not ultimately be recoverable from the related mortgagor, related Liquidation Proceeds or other recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loan. Delinquencies on the Mortgage Loans in respect of which no P&amp;I Advances are made by the Servicer related to Stop Advance Mortgage Loans may adversely affect the yields on the Certificates (other than the Class A-IO-S Certificates).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In the event of a default and ultimate liquidation of any Mortgaged Property, P&amp;I Advances on the related Mortgage Loan will be reimbursed primarily from Liquidation Proceeds on the Mortgaged Property prior to distributions on the Certificates. As a result, P&amp;I Advances have the effect of delaying the allocation of losses to the Certificates. P&amp;I Advances will cause certain classes of subordinate Certificates that would otherwise be allocated Applied Realized Loss Amounts instead to receive regular distributions of interest and principal prior to the liquidation or modification of a Mortgage Loan that they otherwise would not receive in the absence of P&amp;I Advances. If Liquidation Proceeds on a Mortgage Loan are insufficient to reimburse the Servicer or the Master Servicer (in the case of P&amp;I Advances), as applicable, for all P&amp;I Advances made in respect of such Mortgage Loan, the Servicer or the Master Servicer, as applicable, will be reimbursed for such P&amp;I Advances from collections in respect of all Mortgage Loans. In addition, if the Servicer determines in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement that a P&amp;I Advance or Servicing Advance becomes non-recoverable, or (i) with respect to a P&amp;I Advance or Servicing Advance for a Mortgage Loan that is subject to a modification or (ii) with respect to a P&amp;I Advance for a Mortgage Loan that is subject to a deferral, the Servicer will be entitled to reimbursement for such advance upon determination of non-recoverability or at the time of deferral or modification from collections in respect of all the Mortgage Loans prior to any distributions to the Certificateholders. For the avoidance of doubt, if a mortgagor enters into a repayment plan with respect to a Mortgage Loan, the Servicer or Master Servicer, as applicable, will reimburse itself for the related P&amp;I Advances over the course of such repayment plan from collections in respect of the related Mortgage Loan. Any such reimbursements to the Servicer or the Master Servicer (in the case of P&amp;I Advances) will adversely affect the timing of distributions on</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Certificates and may result in Interest Carryforward Amounts if reimbursements are particularly concentrated in a Due Period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Any Applied Realized Loss Amounts on the Mortgage Loans for a Distribution Date will be applied to reduce the Certificate Principal Balances of the Certificates, sequentially, as follows: <i>first</i>, to reduce the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class B-X Certificates until the Certificate Principal Balance of such class of Certificates is reduced to zero; <i>second </i>to reduce the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class B-2 Certificates, until the Certificate Principal Balance of such class of Certificates is reduced to zero; <i>third, </i>to reduce the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class B-1 Certificates until the Certificate Principal Balance of such class of Certificates is reduced to zero; <i>fourth</i>, to reduce the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class M-1 Certificates until the Certificate Principal Balance of such class of Certificates is reduced to zero; <i>fifth</i>, to reduce the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class A-3 Certificates until the Certificate Principal Balance of such class of Certificates is reduced to zero; <i>sixth</i>, to reduce the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class A-2 Certificates until the Certificate Principal Balance of such class of Certificates is reduced to zero; and <i>seventh</i>, to reduce the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class A-1 Certificates until the Certificate Principal Balance of such class of Certificates is reduced to zero, in each case as described in this Offering Memorandum under “<i>Description of the Certificates— Allocation of Losses and Recoveries</i>.” As a result, the yields on the Certificates will depend on the rate and timing of Realized Losses on the Mortgage Loans and the allocation of Applied Realized Loss Amounts as a result thereof. The Class B-X Certificates will be especially sensitive to Realized Losses and reimbursements for Applied Realized Loss Amounts allocated on prior Distribution Date as such amounts will reduce Monthly Excess Cashflow available (if any) for distribution as the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pre-Offering Review of the Mortgage Loans May Not Reveal All Aspects of the Mortgage Loans Which Could Lead to Losses</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Sponsor has undertaken certain limited loan review procedures with respect to various aspects of the Mortgage Loans, including hiring third-party diligence providers at the time of the previous securitizations to conduct a review of the underwriting of the Mortgage Loans and verification of certain aspects of the Mortgage Loans to evaluate conformance with the related Originator’s Underwriting Guidelines. In conducting these review procedures, the diligence providers relied on information and resources available to it (which were limited and which, in most cases, were not independently verified). These review procedures were intended to discover certain material discrepancies and possible material defects in the Mortgage Loans reviewed, however, these procedures did not constitute a re-underwriting of the Mortgage Loans, and were not designed or intended to discover every possible discrepancy or defect. The diligence providers also assisted the Sponsor in assessing the original appraisals of the Mortgage Loans. There can be no assurance that any review process conducted uncovered all relevant aspects that could be determinative of how the reviewed Mortgage Loans will perform.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Furthermore, to the extent that the limited review conducted by the third-party diligence providers did reveal factors that could affect how the Mortgage Loans will perform, the Sponsor may have incorrectly assessed the potential severity of those factors. Investors should make their own determination as the extent to which they place reliance on the limited loan review procedures of the Sponsor. The inclusion of any Mortgage Loan in the Mortgage Pool is not a representation by the Sponsor or any other party with respect to the adequacy or sufficiency of the pre-offering review process with respect to such Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">See “<i>Pre-Offering Review of the Mortgage Loans</i>” in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Review Process Is the Sole and Exclusive Process by which Any Breach of Representations and Warranties May Be Independently Identified and Remedied and No Assurance Can Be Made as to Its Effectiveness</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A significant risk for investors in the Offered Certificates is that losses may be incurred as a result of a defect with respect to a Mortgage Loan, generally unrelated to the credit characteristics of the Mortgage Loan, which results in a loss. However, the Representation Provider has made representations and warranties with respect to the Mortgage Loans related to some of these potential defects. The representations and warranties being made with respect to the Mortgage Loans are complex and cover a number of potential defects with respect to the Mortgage Loans, but may not cover every potential defect which may result in Realized Losses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Edgemac will act as the Representation and Warranty Reviewer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. As more particularly described under “<i>Mortgage Loan Representations and Warranties—The Review Process</i>” upon the occurrence of a Review Trigger with respect to a Mortgage Loan, the Representation and Warranty Reviewer will undertake a review of such Mortgage Loan to test for the accuracy of certain</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">representations and warranties made by the Representation Provider. Annex C contains pre-determined Tests for the determination of whether there has been a material breach of any representation and warranty with respect of an Angel Oak Mortgage Loan. In the case of Third Party Originator Mortgage Loans there are no predetermined review procedures for determination of a material breach. No assurance can be made that any representations and warranties with respect to the Mortgage Loans were or will be true as of any date. The review process, including the final determination by the Representation and Warranty Reviewer, constitutes the sole and exclusive process by which any breach of a representation or warranty with respect to a Mortgage Loan may be identified that would trigger a non-discretionary repurchase, indemnity or substitution with respect to that Mortgage Loan. No assurance can be made that the review process will be able to operate effectively or achieve the intended result of identifying breaches of representations and warranties related to the Mortgage Loans. Even if none of the representations and warranties related to the Mortgage Loans are untrue, the Mortgage Loans may still suffer from defaults, and the Certificates may incur losses or have reduced market values.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A determination by the Representation and Warranty Reviewer represents the analysis and the opinion of the Representation and Warranty Reviewer based on its testing procedures, and there can be no assurance that either the testing procedures or any review using the testing procedures will adequately identify all inaccurate representations and warranties with respect to the subject Mortgage Loans or identify whether any representation or warranty that does not satisfy a particular Test will result in a Material Breach. The Representation Provider will not have any obligation to cure a breach of a Mortgage Loan representation and warranty or repurchase or substitute a Mortgage Loan or pay a loss amount as a result of a breach of a representation and warranty unless either (i) the Representation and Warranty Reviewer finds that a Material Breach has occurred or (ii) the arbitrator in the arbitration proceeding determines that there was a Material Breach. As a result, there may be Mortgage Loans that breach representations and warranties for which the Issuing Entity will have no available remedies against the Representation Provider, or with respect to which no remedies are pursued.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Except with respect to the right of Certificateholders to initiate a Certificateholder Review Trigger as described under “<i>Mortgage Loan Representations and Warranties—The Review Process,</i>” no Certificateholder will have any right to make, or direct the Trustee to make, a repurchase request or other request for consideration with respect to or involving any alleged breach. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Custodian, the Servicing Administrator, the Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Depositor or the Seller or any other party will have any obligation to consider, respond to or otherwise investigate any alleged breach of representation or warranty whether by a Certificateholder or otherwise.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Additionally, the Representation and Warranty Reviewer will conduct its review based on the information in the review materials provided to it and other generally available documentation. Therefore, unless some documentation that would cause a Test performed by the Representation and Warranty Reviewer to be failed is clearly contained in the review materials for the Mortgage Loan, the Representation and Warranty Reviewer will not be able to determine if a Mortgage Loan has failed a Test. See “<i>Description of the Mortgage Loans— Review Procedures</i>.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Representation Provider, the Controlling Representative or the Review Triggering Certificateholders may dispute a determination of a Material Breach (or a finding that there has been no Material Breach) made by the Representation and Warranty Reviewer. To the extent there is a dispute regarding the above-referenced review or the actions that should be taken in as a result of such review, the method for resolution of such dispute will be arbitration. The arbitration proceedings may take a substantial amount of time. The costs and expenses of arbitration will be borne by (i) the Representation Provider, if such arbitration is initiated by the Representation Provider; provided that if the Representation Provider prevails in such arbitration, the costs and expenses of such arbitration will be reimbursable to the Representation Provider (and consequently borne by Certificateholders), subject to the Annual Cap, (ii) the Controlling Representative if such arbitration is initiated by the Controlling Representative; provided that if the Controlling Representative prevails in such arbitration, the costs and expenses of such arbitration will be reimbursable to the Controlling Representative (and consequently borne by Certificateholders), subject to the Annual Cap or (iii) the Review Triggering Certificateholders if such arbitration is initiated by the Review Triggering Certificateholders; provided that if such Review Triggering Certificateholders prevail in the arbitration, the costs and expenses of such arbitration will be reimbursable to the Review Triggering Certificateholders (and consequently borne by all Certificateholders), subject to the Annual Cap. Any such costs and expenses reimbursable to the Controlling Representative, the Representation Provider or the Review Triggering Certificateholders, as applicable, will be paid prior to making distributions of principal and interest on the Certificates and could result in losses to the Certificateholders. In addition, the mechanism for the use of an independent representation and warranty reviewer and arbitrator is untested and may not be an effective way to ensure that Material Breaches are remedied. It is unclear, for example, what standards the arbitrator will</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">use in determining the existence and materiality of a breach. It is also unclear what the cost of these parties might be, and any expense associated with these parties, including the cost of any arbitration reimbursable to the Controlling Representative (subject to the Annual Cap), will be an expense of the Issuing Entity, and will be allocated to reduce the Net WAC Rate, which will reduce the amount of interest payable to any class of Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">There may be substantial delay between the date on which a Review Trigger occurs with respect to a Mortgage Loan, the date of a determination by the Representation and Warranty Reviewer of a Material Breach (if any such determination is made) and the date on which the Representation Provider fulfills its obligation to remedy any such Material Breach. Any such delays may reduce amounts available to make distributions of principal and interest on the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Representation and Warranty Reviewer will not perform any Test related to representation and warranty number 6 set forth under “<i>Mortgage Loan Representations and Warranties—Representations and Warranties of the Representation Provider</i>” with respect to any Angel Oak Mortgage Loan or, for any Third Party Originator Mortgage Loan, a review with respect to the representation and warranty that is substantially similar to representation and warranty number 6 set forth under “<i>Mortgage Loan Representations and Warranties— Representations and Warranties of the Representation Provider</i>,” for which a Review Trigger occurred on any date after the date on which the Certificate Principal Balances of the Rated Certificates are reduced to zero, and consequently, the Issuing Entity will have no remedies with respect to breaches of such representation or warranty in respect of Angel Oak Mortgage Loans or Third Party Originator Mortgage Loans for which a Review Trigger occurred on any date after the Certificate Principal Balances of the Rated Certificates are reduced to zero.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Representation and Warranty Reviewer will not be required to conduct any Test to determine whether there has been a breach related to representation and warranty number 40 set forth under “<i>Mortgage Loan Representations and Warranties—Representations and Warranties of the Representation Provider</i>” with respect to any Angel Oak Mortgage Loan or, for any Third Party Originator Mortgage Loan, the representation and warranty that is substantially similar to representation and warranty number 40 set forth under “<i>Mortgage Loan Representations and Warranties—Representations and Warranties of the Representation Provider</i>.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a judicial determination has been made that (a) a violation of the TRID rule exists with respect to such Mortgage Loan, (b) assignee liability applies to such violation and (c) statutory damages and/or out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees in excess of $400 are payable with respect to such violation, the Servicer will be required to provide the Servicing Administrator, the Trustee, the Representation and Warranty Reviewer and the Representation Provider with written notice thereof within 30 business days and the Representation Provider will have 60 business days from the first date on which the events described in clauses (a), (b) and (c) have all occurred to (A) cure the breach (including by making an indemnity payment to the Issuing Entity sufficient to compensate it for any amounts payable by the Issuing Entity that are described in clause (c) above), (B) repurchase the related Mortgage Loan from the Issuing Entity at the Repurchase Price, (C) in some circumstances, substitute another mortgage loan for the related Mortgage Loan or (D) make an indemnity payment with respect to a Liquidated Loan, in all cases without regard to whether the related TRID rule violation materially and adversely affects the value of such Mortgage Loan or the interests of the Certificateholders therein.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In December 2013, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, ruled that the six-year statute of limitations applicable to contract causes of action barred an action for breach of representations and warranties contained in a mortgage loan purchase agreement and incorporated by reference in a pooling and servicing agreement governed by New York law. The court held that the claims for breach of representations and warranties accrued on the date of the breach, which in this case was the closing date of the transaction. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement is governed by New York law. On June 11, 2015, the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in New York, affirmed the ruling of the lower court. On November 16, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held under New York law that a claim for breaches of representations and warranties concerning the characteristics of mortgage loans accrues on the date the representations and warranties are made, even where the contract purports to set an alternative time period for such accrual.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Investors in the Offered Certificates are strongly encouraged to review “<i>Mortgage Loan Representations and Warranties—Representations and Warranties of the Representation Provider With Respect to the Mortgage Loans</i>” in this Offering Memorandum for a list of the representations and warranties made by the Representation Provider  and “<i>Mortgage  Loan Representations and  Warranties—The Review  Process</i>” for  the  mechanism whereby claims for breaches against the Representation Provider are made, including the Representation and Warranty Reviewer’s obligation to review Mortgage Loans for breaches of representations and warranties and the use of an arbitrator to resolve disputes.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Limited Diligence with Respect to Mortgage Loan Representation and Warranties</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Any diligence conducted with respect to the representations and warranties of the Representation Provider with respect to the Mortgage Loans was limited in scope and subject to other limitations. Such representations and warranties have been made for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties to those agreements rather than to establish matters of fact. As a general matter, the truth and accuracy of the substance of certain of the matters addressed in such representations and warranties cannot be verified, and consequently would not be revealed through any diligence process. For example, the legal capacity of a mortgagor generally would not be ascertainable through any diligence conducted on the Mortgage Loans. In addition, as further discussed in this Offering Memorandum, any review of such Mortgage Loan representations and warranties was limited by the data contained in the files made available for such purposes, which in some cases were incomplete and may not have been accurate. As a result, no assurance can be given that any representation and warranty with respect to the Mortgage Loans made by the Representation Provider is true and accurate. Investors are urged to make their own determination as to whether the limited diligence conducted with respect to such representations and warranties described in this Offering Memorandum is sufficient to meet their investment criteria.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Credit Scores May Not Accurately Predict the Likelihood of Default</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Each Originator generally uses credit scores as part of its underwriting process. Credit scores are generated by models developed by third party credit reporting organizations which analyzed data on consumers in order to establish patterns which are believed to be indicative of a mortgagor’s probability of default. A credit score represents an opinion of the related credit reporting organization of a mortgagor’s creditworthiness. The credit score is based on a mortgagor’s historical credit data, including, among other things, payment history, delinquencies on accounts, levels of outstanding indebtedness, length of credit history, types of credit, and bankruptcy experience. Credit scores can range from approximately 300 to approximately 850, with higher scores indicating an individual with a more favorable credit history compared to an individual with a lower score. A credit score purports only to be a measurement of the relative degree of risk a mortgagor represents to a lender, i.e., that a mortgagor with a higher score is statistically expected to be less likely to default in payment than a mortgagor with a lower score. In addition, it should be noted that credit scores were developed to indicate a level of default probability over a two-year period, which does not correspond to the life of most mortgage loans. Credit scores do not necessarily correspond to the probability of default over the life of the related mortgage loan, because they reflect past credit history, rather than an assessment of future payment performance. Furthermore, credit scores were not developed specifically for use in connection with mortgage loans, but for consumer loans in general. Therefore, credit scores do not address particular mortgage loan characteristics that influence the probability of repayment by the mortgagor. The credit scores used as part of the underwriting process were generated prior to the COVID-19 outbreak and therefore may not be indicative of a mortgagor’s current creditworthiness. In addition, credit scores presently generated may not be indicative of a mortgagor’s true creditworthiness as a result of legislation that prohibits the reporting of delinquencies to credit bureaus while a borrower is subject to payment forbearance due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Credit scores should not be considered as an accurate predictor of the likelihood of repayment of the Mortgage Loans. None of the Sponsor, the Seller, the Depositor, the Representation Provider or the Initial Purchasers makes any representation or warranty as to any mortgagor’s current credit score or the actual performance of any mortgage loan or that a particular credit score should be relied upon as a basis for an expectation that a mortgagor will repay its mortgage loan according to its terms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Geographic Concentration May Increase Risk of Loss Due to Adverse Economic Conditions or Natural Disasters</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Approximately 30.32% of the Mortgage Loans are secured by properties located in California, approximately 24.11% of the Mortgage Loans are secured by properties located in Florida, approximately 7.82% of the Mortgage Loans are secured by properties located in Texas and approximately 5.74% of the Mortgage Loans are secured by properties located in Georgia, in each case by Scheduled Principal Balance as of the Cut-off Date. Furthermore, within these state concentrations are significant concentrations of Mortgage Loans secured by Mortgaged Properties located within certain cities and regional areas within one or more states. Adverse economic conditions (including weakness in the regional housing market), the COVID-19 outbreak and natural disasters in those regions or states with a higher concentration of Mortgage Loans will have a disproportionate impact on the rate of delinquencies, defaults and losses on the Mortgage Loans in the aggregate. Volatility in regional and local housing markets similarly may have a disproportionate impact on the rate of prepayments, delinquencies, defaults and losses on the Mortgage Loans. In particular, certain regional areas have experienced a rapid increase in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">property values due to extremely low inventory of homes for sale during the COVID-19 outbreak. Consequently, these regions have an increased risk of a decline in property values which could result in losses on the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Areas of the United States may from time to time be affected by flooding, severe storms, hurricanes, landslides, wildfires, earthquakes or other natural disasters, or the effects of global climate change (which may include flooding, drought or severe weather). Under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Representation Provider will represent and warrant that, as of the Closing Date each Mortgaged Property was free of material damage. If any damage caused by flooding, storms, wildfires, landslides or earthquakes (or other causes) occurs after the Closing Date, no entity will have any repurchase or indemnification obligation. In addition, the standard hazard policies covering the Mortgaged Properties generally do not cover damage caused by earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding and landslides, and earthquake, hurricane, flood or landslide insurance may not have been obtained with respect to such Mortgaged Properties. The Representation Provider, the Seller and the Depositor have made no investigation to determine whether such insurance is necessary. As a consequence, Realized Losses or Applied Realized Loss Amounts could result. A severe earthquake, wildfire, hurricane or other natural or manmade catastrophe in California, Florida, Georgia or Texas could result in losses in the Certificates, including the senior Certificates. In addition, significant changes in regional climate conditions could have effects that are difficult to foresee. To the extent that a locality becomes more susceptible to extreme temperatures or weather events or otherwise becomes less desirable as a place to live, property values could be adversely affected and rates of default could increase.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The cost of the impact of these natural disasters, due to the physical damage they caused, as well as the related economic impact, is expected to be significant for some period of time, particularly in the areas most directly damaged. One or more Mortgaged Properties may be affected by changes in the regional or local economies that have resulted or may result from these natural disasters. Any long-lasting effects of the natural disasters may subsequently affect housing prices and homeowners’ ability to make mortgage payments in the impacted areas.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">No assurance can be given as to the effect of these natural disasters on the rate of delinquencies and losses on the Mortgage Loans secured by Mortgaged Properties that were or may be affected by these natural disasters or as to damage of properties. Any adverse impact as a result of these natural disasters may be borne by the Certificateholders, particularly if the Representation Provider fails to purchase any Mortgage Loan that breaches the representation and warranty described above.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Additionally, if a mortgaged property at origination is in an area identified in the Federal Register by FEMA as having special flood hazards, the mortgagor is required to maintain a flood insurance policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration. Investors should note, however, that many areas that have suffered flood damage in recent years are not located in areas identified in the Federal Register by FEMA as having special flood hazards and as such, may not be covered by any flood insurance. Additionally, coverage under flood insurance policies is generally significantly smaller than the Scheduled Principal Balances of the related Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Any deterioration in housing prices in the regions in which there is a significant concentration of Mortgaged Properties, as well as the other regions in which the Mortgaged Properties are located, and any deterioration of economic conditions in such regions which adversely affects the ability of mortgagors to make payments on the Mortgage Loans, may increase the likelihood of delinquencies and losses on the Mortgage Loans. Conversely, any increase in the market value of properties located in the regions in which the Mortgaged Properties are located and/or temporary measures to lower interest rates in response to the COVID-19 outbreak may result in the availability of alternative sources of financing at lower interest rates, which could result in an increased rate of prepayment of the Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Representation Provider will make a representation and warranty that, as of the Closing Date, each Mortgaged Property underlying a Mortgage Loan is undamaged by water, fire, earthquake, earth movement other than earthquake, windstorm, flood, tornado or similar casualty (excluding casualty from the presence of hazardous wastes or hazardous substances) to affect adversely the value of the Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan or the use for which the premises was intended or would render the property uninhabitable, and that there is no pending or threatened proceeding for the total or partial condemnation of the Mortgaged Property. In the event any Mortgaged Property was damaged in connection with these natural disasters, the Representation Provider may be required to purchase such Mortgage Loan from the Issuing Entity, which will have the same effect on the Certificates as a prepayment in full of such Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">There are also significant concentrations of Mortgage Loans in other states and cities. See Annex A to this Offering Memorandum. Consequently, losses and prepayments on the Mortgage Loans and the resultant payments on the Certificates may be affected significantly by changes in the housing markets and the regional economies in any of these areas and by the occurrence of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, landslides, wildfires and floods in these areas.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assessments and Energy Efficiency Liens May Take Priority Over the Mortgage Lien</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Mortgaged properties securing the Mortgage Loans may be subject to a lien for property taxes and/or assessments. These liens may be superior to the liens securing the Mortgage Loans, irrespective of the date of the mortgage. In some instances, Mortgage Loans secured by properties that have a homeowners’ association (including condominiums) may be subject to super-priority liens of homeowners’ associations to secure payment of periodic dues. If the related homeowners’ association or other lien owner were to enforce the lien for non- payment of dues, there can be no assurance that a foreclosure sale would not occur and that the Liquidation Proceeds received would be sufficient to satisfy the related Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In other instances, individual mortgagors may be able to elect to enter into contracts with governmental agencies for Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) or similar assessments that are intended to secure the payment of energy and water efficiency and distributed energy generation improvements that are permanently affixed to their properties, possibly without notice to or the consent of the mortgagee. These assessments may also have lien priority over the mortgages securing mortgage loans. No assurance can be given that any Mortgaged Property so assessed will increase in value to the extent of the assessment lien. Additional indebtedness secured by the assessment lien would reduce the amount of the value of the Mortgaged Property available to satisfy the affected Mortgage Loan. The Representation Provider makes no representation or warranty with respect to any such lien nor will the Representation Provider be required to take any actions or be subject to any liability with respect to any such lien.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Mortgage Loans May Have Limited Recourse to the Related Mortgagor, Which May Result in Losses with Respect to These Mortgage Loans</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Some or all of the Mortgage Loans will be nonrecourse loans or loans for which recourse may be restricted or unenforceable. As to those Mortgage Loans, recourse in the event of mortgagor default will be limited to the specific real property and other assets, if any, that were pledged to secure the Mortgage Loan. However, even with respect to those Mortgage Loans that provide for recourse against the mortgagor and its assets generally, there can be no assurance that enforcement of the recourse provisions will be practicable or permitted by applicable law, or that the other assets of the mortgagor will be sufficient to permit a recovery in respect of a defaulted Mortgage Loan in excess of the liquidation value of the related Mortgaged Property. In addition, in light of the current regulatory environment, the Servicer has no obligation, and may be reluctant, to pursue deficiency judgments, even where permitted by applicable law. Any risks associated with Mortgage Loans with no or limited recourse may affect the yields to maturity of the Certificates to the extent losses caused by these risks are not covered by credit enhancement or covered by the repurchase, indemnification or substitution remedies with respect to breaches of representations and warranties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Recording of the Mortgages in the Name of MERS Could Increase the Risk of Loss</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The mortgages or assignments of mortgage for 831 of the 841 Mortgage Loans have been recorded in the name of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., or “MERS,” solely as nominee for the related Originator and its successors and assigns, including the Trustee. Subsequent assignments of those mortgages are registered electronically through the MERS system. However, if MERS discontinues the MERS system, a monthly payment on a Mortgage Loan recorded in the name of MERS has not been received within 90 days of its due date, a court of competent jurisdiction in a particular state rules that MERS is not an appropriate system for transferring ownership of Mortgage Loans in that state, or MERS goes into bankruptcy or becomes the subject of a receivership or conservatorship, and it becomes necessary for the Depositor or the Servicer to record or cause the recordation of assignments of those mortgages to the Trustee on behalf of the Issuing Entity, any related expenses will be paid by the Issuing Entity and will reduce the amounts available to make distributions on the certificates. As a result, distributions on your Offered Certificates could be reduced.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The recording of mortgages in the name of MERS has been challenged through the judicial system. Although most decisions have accepted MERS as mortgagee, its right to notice of actions and its authority to foreclose as mortgagee, has been found by a state-level court to be not contingently necessary in a mortgage</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">foreclosure suit because MERS did not have an interest that was impaired by its failure to receive notice of the foreclosure suit.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">On February 3, 2012, the New York State Attorney General filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., MERS, and certain related parties, charging that the creation and use of MERS has resulted in a wide range of deceptive and fraudulent foreclosure filings in New York courts, seeking damages and injunctive relief for alleged harm to homeowners and to the judicial foreclosure process. The lawsuit alleged, among other things, that many assignments purported to assign mortgages from MERS to a foreclosing party were automatically generated and signed by individuals who did not review or confirm pertinent facts, and that the use of MERS had created gaps in the chain of title. A portion of the damages claim was resolved on March 13, 2012, as part of the National Mortgage Settlement reached contemporaneously, and the remaining aspects of the lawsuit were settled on June 18, 2013; the latter settlement including certain changes in servicing practices. The defendants did not admit liability in connection with the settlements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Washington Supreme Court ruled that if MERS is not the holder of the Mortgage Note, then it is not considered to be the beneficiary for purposes of non-judicial foreclosures in the State of Washington. To the extent non-judicial foreclosures are commenced in the State of Washington with MERS as beneficiary rather than as agent for the holder of the Mortgage Note, such foreclosures may need to be restarted. Similarly, the Supreme Court of Maine held in 2014 that assignments of mortgage conducted by MERS were invalid and would render the assignee unable to foreclose on the mortgage. Many cases involving issues related to MERS and the MERS system are pending, and more may continue to be filed. The law in this area continues to develop, and the course of decisions and their implications, cannot be predicted or accurately evaluated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If MERS discontinues the MERS system and it becomes necessary for the Depositor or the Servicer to record or cause the recordation of assignments of those mortgages in the name of the Trustee, any related expenses will be paid by the Issuing Entity and will reduce the amounts available to make distributions on the Certificates. In addition, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, it is possible that many local recording offices may be operated by reduced staff and/or encountering extensive backlogs, which could prevent the Depositor or the Servicer from recording assignments as and when required.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">While the requirement to assign mortgages out of MERS prior to commencing a foreclosure proceeding may help reduce the number of challenges to the MERS system, legal challenges to the validity of the ownership of a mortgage loan held through MERS continue to exist and such challenges to MERS could result in delays and additional costs in commencing, prosecuting and completing foreclosure proceedings and conducting foreclosure sales of Mortgaged Properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Failures or Delays in Endorsing Notes and Recording Assignments of Mortgage Could Increase Risk of Loss</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">After the Closing Date, assignments of the mortgages to the Trustee on behalf of the Issuing Entity are required to be prepared and delivered to the Custodian, but only certain of those assignments will be recorded. As a result, record title for every mortgage loan will not be assigned to the Trustee on behalf of the Issuing Entity. Similarly, the Mortgage Notes will not be endorsed to the Trustee on behalf of the Issuing Entity, but endorsements in blank are required to be delivered to the Custodian.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The failure to record (or delay in recording) the assignments of the mortgages in the name of the Issuing Entity could result in the loss of the underlying mortgage liens. For example, prior to the recording of the assignments, the mortgage lien could be discharged if the record owner filed a release or satisfaction of such mortgage lien, whether inadvertently or intentionally. A loss of the underlying mortgage lien also could occur if a governmental authority foreclosed on the Mortgaged Property and notice to the record owner was not forwarded to the Servicer in a timely manner.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, the failure to record (or delay in recording) the assignments of the mortgages could impair the ability of the Servicer to take timely servicing actions with respect to the Mortgage Loans, which could reduce the value realized from such Mortgage Loans. Some of the assignments may be assignments in blank that have been filled in. Questions have been raised about the validity and enforceability of assignments in blank. The Servicer may have to record the related assignments of mortgage prior to filing a foreclosure proceeding. The expenses of recording will be treated as a Servicing Advance and will reduce the amount available to make distributions on the Certificates. There could be delays in commencing the foreclosure proceedings as a result of the need to record assignments of mortgages, which could lead to delays or reductions in distributions on the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Certificates. If the related assignments cannot be located at the time of foreclosure, if an assignment is missing in the chain of title or if an assignment in blank that has been filled in cannot be recorded, it may not be possible to foreclose.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, it may not be possible to commence foreclosure proceedings until the related Mortgage Note has been endorsed to the Trustee on behalf of the Issuing Entity. If a necessary endorsement is missing and cannot be obtained, it may not be possible to foreclose.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the inability of the Servicer, because it is not the mortgagee of record, to timely release the lien of the mortgage on a Mortgage Loan that has been paid in full could expose the Issuing Entity to claims and liability for violations of applicable law, thus reducing the amount available to make distributions on the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If the prior owner that is the mortgagee of record were to go into bankruptcy or similar proceedings within 90 days (or in some cases, one year) after the post-closing recording of any assignment, it may be possible for the recorded assignment to be avoided as a preferential transfer, so that there is no effective assignment of record, possibly leading to consequences of the type described above. There may be other consequences of a failure to record assignments if the prior owner goes into bankruptcy or similar proceedings before the relevant assignments are recorded. If the prior owner is a bank that goes into conservatorship or receivership, a failure to record assignments may permit the FDIC as receiver or conservator of the prior owner to challenge the transfer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The occurrence of any of these circumstances could result in delays or reductions in distributions on the Certificates, or other losses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Violations of Various Federal, State and Local Laws May Result in Losses on the Mortgage Loans</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Numerous federal, state and local consumer protection laws impose substantive requirements upon mortgage lenders and holders of mortgage loans in connection with the origination, servicing and enforcement of mortgage loans. Applicable state and local laws regulate, among other things, interest rates and other charges, closing practices, compensation and licensing of brokers, lenders, holders and individual loan originators; and may require certain disclosures. In addition, other federal, state and local laws, public policy and general principles of equity relating to the protection of consumers, unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, and debt collection practices may be applied to the origination, ownership, servicing and collection of the Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The CFPB, state and federal banking regulatory agencies, state attorneys general offices, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and state and local governmental authorities continue to monitor lending practices by some originators, including practices sometimes referred to as “predatory lending” practices as well as fair lending requirements. State, local and federal governmental agencies have imposed sanctions on originators for practices including, but not limited to, charging mortgagors excessive fees, steering mortgagors to loans with higher costs or more onerous terms, imposing higher interest rates than the mortgagor’s credit risk warrants and failing to adequately disclose the material terms of loans to the mortgagors. Additional requirements may be imposed under federal, state or local laws on so-called “high cost mortgage loans” or “higher-priced mortgage loans,” which typically are defined as loans secured by a consumer’s dwelling that have interest rates or origination costs in excess of prescribed levels. These laws may limit certain loan terms, such as prepayment charges, balloon payments or late fees, or the ability of a creditor to refinance a loan unless it is in the mortgagor’s interest, and may require counseling of mortgagors before a loan is originated. In addition, certain of these laws may allow claims against loan brokers or originators, including claims based on fraud or misrepresentations, to be asserted against persons acquiring the loans, such as the Issuing Entity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">State and local governments may also require originators, servicers and holders of mortgage loans to obtain certain licenses and permits. The Issuing Entity has not obtained any licenses or permits in connection with holding the Mortgage Loans and no assurance can be given that a state or local government will not assert that the Issuing Entity must obtain a particular license or permit. No assurance can be given that each Originator, the Sponsor, the Seller, the Servicer, the Depositor and each other party involved in the origination, servicing and holding of the Mortgage Loans had obtained all appropriate licenses and permits at the appropriate time in connection with the Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Federal laws also apply to the origination, servicing, collection and enforcement of mortgage loans, including:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">TILA and Regulation Z promulgated under TILA, which (among other things) require certain disclosures to mortgagors regarding the terms of loans – including disclosures provided in advance of loan origination and (in some cases) on periodic statements and in advance of rate adjustments, and disclosures or loan transfers – and provide consumers who pledged their principal dwelling as collateral in a non-purchase money transaction with a right of rescission that generally extends for three days after proper disclosures are given, and otherwise regulate mortgage transactions, such as by restricting compensation paid to loan brokers and otherwise regulating broker practices, restricting advertising practices and requiring that certain terms be included in advertisements, prohibiting arbitration provisions, limiting prepayment fees in certain circumstances, mandating escrow accounts for certain loans, requiring prompt crediting of payments, prohibiting certain practices relating to appraisals and requiring lenders to consider the ability of the consumer to repay certain loans;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and its regulations, which (among other things) prohibit the payment of referral fees for real estate settlement services (including mortgage lending and brokerage services) and regulate escrow accounts for taxes and insurance and billing inquiries made by mortgagors;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated under that Act, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of age, race, color, sex, religion, marital status, national origin, receipt of public assistance or the exercise of any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act, in the extension of credit;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which regulates the practices employed to collect consumer debts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use and reporting of information related to the mortgagor’s credit experience;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">the Relief Act, which may require interest rate reductions, and temporary suspension of legal proceedings that may adversely affect the rights of servicemembers, during their military service;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">the Consumer Financial Protection Act, enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, which (among other things) created the CFPB and gave it broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement jurisdiction over mortgage lenders and servicers, and proscribes any unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with any consumer financial product or service;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">the Dodd-Frank Act, including as described above under “<i>—Governmental Intervention, Financial Regulatory Reforms and Proposed Regulations Could Have a Significant Impact on the Sponsor, the Seller, the Depositor, the Issuing Entity, the Originators, the Servicing Administrator, the Servicer, the Master Servicer or on the Value or Marketability of the Certificates</i>”;

In particular, any failure of the Originator, the Servicer, the Master Servicer or the Issuing Entity to comply with certain requirements of federal and state laws could subject the Issuing Entity (and other assignees of the Mortgage Loans) to monetary penalties, and result in obligors’ rescinding the Mortgage Loans against either the Issuing Entity or subsequent holders of the Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">It is possible in the future that governmental authorities or attorneys general may take actions that could prohibit servicers of the mortgage loans from pursuing foreclosure actions, provide new defenses to foreclosure</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">or otherwise limit the ability of a servicer to take actions (such as pursuing foreclosure) that may be essential to preserve the value of a mortgage loan.

Losses on Mortgage Loans from the application of any applicable federal, state and local laws that are not otherwise covered by one or more forms of credit enhancement will be borne by the holders of one or more related classes of Certificates. Additionally, the Issuing Entity may experience losses arising from lawsuits related to alleged violations of these laws, which, if not covered by one or more forms of credit enhancement, will be borne by the holders of one or more related classes of Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Modification of a Mortgage Loan May Adversely Affect Your Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">To limit losses on delinquent Mortgage Loans and maximize collections, the Servicer may use loss mitigation measures, including forbearance agreements and other modification agreements and pre-foreclosure sales, subject to the consent of the Servicing Administrator (to the extent required by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) in connection with any modifications, waivers and amendments of a Mortgage Loan that (1) extends the scheduled final maturity date of the Mortgage Loan, (2) waives, reduces or postpones any scheduled repayment, (3) reduces the Mortgage Interest Rate (except for a reduction of interest payments resulting from the application of the Relief Act or any similar state statutes) or (4) extends the time for payment of any interest or fees. Modifications of Mortgage Loans implemented by the Servicer in order to maximize ultimate proceeds of the Mortgage Loans may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the Mortgage Interest Rate, forgiving payments of principal, interest or other amounts owed under the Mortgage Loan, such as taxes or insurance premiums, extending the maturity date of the Mortgage Loan, capitalizing or deferring delinquent interest and other amounts owed under the Mortgage Loan, reducing the Unpaid Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loan or any combination of these or other modifications. Any modified Mortgage Loan may remain in the Issuing Entity, and the reduction in collections resulting from a modification may result in reduced distributions of interest on or principal of the Certificates. If the Servicer reduces the Mortgage Interest Rate, extends the payment period or accepts a lesser amount than stated in the Mortgage Note in satisfaction of the Mortgage Note, or charges off or sells  the  Mortgage Loan, amounts available to make distributions on  the Certificates will be reduced. A modification allowing principal forgiveness may result in the allocation of an Applied Realized Loss Amount to the most subordinate class of Certificates outstanding. Modifications that reduce the Mortgage Interest Rate due on a Mortgage Loan will decrease the Net WAC Rate, which may reduce Current Interest on each class of P&amp;I Certificates, and subordination will not protect holders of the senior Certificates from these reductions. Reductions in the Net WAC Rate will also reduce the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">As of November 30, 2021, none of the mortgagors are on an active forbearance plan from the Servicer due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, 34 of the mortgagors, representing approximately 4.02% of the Mortgage Pool, had their initial two or more month forbearance term expire, are no longer on an active forbearance plan and are current as of the Cut-off Date. Twelve Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 1.35% of the Mortgage Pool, have $209,839.91 of Pre-Closing Deferred Amounts. At the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, mortgagors who requested relief on their Mortgage Loans due to the COVID-19 outbreak were automatically granted an initial three month forbearance period by the Servicer. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, however, the Servicer and the Servicing Administrator have developed a hardship affidavit for each mortgagor to complete prior to granting three months of forbearance. In either case, the Servicer may extend the forbearance period on a case-by-case basis if the mortgagor cannot repay the forborne payments immediately and a subsequent loss mitigation option is not finalized (or the hardship affidavit has not been submitted by the borrower/reviewed by the Servicer). At the end of the forbearance period, the Servicer will require each mortgagor who cannot repay the forborne payments in full (to the extent not prohibited by law) to provide a package of employment, financial and credit information so that the Servicer and the Servicing Administrator may evaluate the optimal loss mitigation option, based on a waterfall of loss mitigation options, jointly developed by the Servicer and the Servicing Administrator. Such options include, but are not limited to, various repayment plans (which may include partial use of unemployment benefits), deferral plans, capitalization and extension plans, rate and/or term modifications, short sales, principal reduction modifications and deed-in-lieu transactions for mortgagors impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. The Servicer will inform the Servicing Administrator of the loss mitigation option selected and will provide all supporting documentation to the Servicing Administrator for review and approval. The Servicer and the Servicing Administrator will continue to evaluate and implement a variety of loss mitigation techniques with respect to delinquent and defaulted loans over the course of the transaction, including</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in response to any governmental programs designed to keep mortgagors in their homes, in an effort to maximize distributions to the Certificateholders while taking into account the best interests of the mortgagors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Furthermore, mortgagors in the Mortgage Pool may have contacted or in the future could contact the Servicer indicating financial distress as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and/or request relief which could increase the number of mortgagors in the pool who receive forbearance or other loss mitigation options due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Any of these loss mitigation options selected by the Servicer and approved by the Servicing Administrator may result in reduced or delayed collections on the Mortgage Loans, which will have an adverse effect on the Certificates. See also “<i>Prepayment and Yield Considerations</i>” and “—<i>COVID-19 Outbreak Forbearances and Modifications May Impact an Investment in the Offered Certificates</i>” in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mortgage Loan Modification Programs and Future Legislative Action May Adversely Affect the Performance and Market Value of the Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In 2008 and 2009, the federal government commenced implementation of programs designed to provide homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures. In addition, certain mortgage lenders and servicers have voluntarily, or as part of settlements with law enforcement authorities, established loan modification programs relating to the mortgages they hold or service. These programs may involve, among other things, the modification of mortgage loans to reduce the rate of interest payable on the loans, to extend the payment terms of the loans, to forgive principal or to forbear the payment of a portion of principal on the mortgage loan without interest. In addition, members of Congress have indicated support for additional legislative relief for homeowners, including a proposed amendment of the bankruptcy laws to permit the modification of mortgage loans in bankruptcy proceedings. See “—<i>The COVID-19 Outbreak May Adversely Affect the Performance, Liquidity and Market Value of the Offered Certificates</i>” in this Offering Memorandum for a discussion of emergency measures and recommendations adopted by the U.S. federal government and several state and local governments in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Recent and future regulatory initiatives may have the effect of increasing modification and loss mitigation activity with respect to performing mortgage loans. Any new laws, regulations or rules may result in reduced collections from the Mortgage Loans and, to the extent not covered by credit enhancement, reduced distributions or losses on one or more classes of the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Return on Your Certificates Could Be Reduced by Shortfalls Due to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Relief Act and similar state laws provide relief to mortgagors who enter active military service and to mortgagors in reserve status who are called to active duty after the origination of their mortgage loan. The Relief Act provides generally that a mortgagor who is covered by the Relief Act may not be charged interest on a mortgage loan in excess of 6% per annum during the period of the mortgagor’s active duty and for one year thereafter. Current or future military operations of the United States may result in an increase in the number of mortgagors who may be in active military service, and the activation of additional U.S. military reservists or members of the National Guard (especially in light of the COVID-19 outbreak), which may in turn significantly increase the proportion of mortgage loans whose mortgage rates are reduced by application of the Relief Act. In addition, Mortgage Loans in the Mortgage Pool that have not been identified as such may already be subject to the Relief Act. The amount of interest available for distribution to Certificateholders will be reduced by any reductions in the amount of interest collectible as a result of application of the Relief Act or similar state or local laws, and none of the Servicing Administrator, the Servicer or any other party will be required to fund any interest shortfall caused by any these reductions. Interest shortfalls on the Mortgage Loans due to the application of the Relief Act or similar legislation or regulations will be applied to reduce accrued interest on the P&amp;I Certificates, <i>pro rata</i>, based on the Current Interest otherwise payable to each such class of Certificates. See also “—<i>Net Interest Shortfalls Resulting from Principal Prepayments and the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act or Similar State Legislation Will Reduce Distributions of Interest on the Offered Certificates</i>.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Relief Act also limits the ability of the servicers to foreclose on a mortgage loan during the mortgagor’s period of active duty and, in some cases, during an additional nine month period thereafter. As a result, there may be delays in payment and increased losses on the Mortgage Loans. Those delays and increased losses will be borne primarily by the class of Certificates with a Certificate Principal Balance greater than zero with the lowest distribution priority. As of the Cut-off Date, none of the mortgagors is known to be subject to the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Relief Act but we cannot predict whether any Mortgage Loans may be affected in the future by the application of the Relief Act or similar legislation or regulations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Governmental and Other Actions May Affect Servicing of the Mortgage Loans and May Limit the Servicer’s Ability to Foreclose</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The federal government, state and local governments, consumer advocacy groups and others continue to urge servicers to be aggressive in modifying mortgage loans to avoid foreclosure, and federal, state and local governmental authorities have enacted and continue to propose numerous laws, regulations and rules relating to mortgage loans generally, and foreclosure actions particularly. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in the implementation of measures to temporarily suspend foreclosures and similar or more significant measures may be implemented in the near future. See “—<i>The COVID-19 Outbreak May Adversely Affect the Performance, Liquidity and Market Value of the Offered Certificates” </i>in this Offering Memorandum. Any of these laws, regulations and rules may provide new defenses to foreclosure, insulate the Servicer from liability for modification of Mortgage Loans without regard to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or result in limitations on upward adjustment of Mortgage Interest Rates, reduced payments by mortgagors, permanent forgiveness of debt, increased prepayments due to the availability of government-sponsored refinancing initiatives and/or increased reimbursable servicing expenses, all of which are likely to result in delays and may result in reductions in the distributions to be made on the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Several courts and state and local governments and their elected or appointed officials also have taken unprecedented steps to slow the foreclosure process or prevent foreclosures altogether. A number of laws have been enacted, including in California and New York. These laws, regulations and rules will result in delays in the foreclosure process, and may lead to reduced payments by mortgagors or increased reimbursable servicing expenses. In addition, Congress and various state and local legislatures are considering or have adopted legislation that, among other things, would permit limited assignee liability for certain violations in the mortgage loan origination process. We cannot predict whether or in what form Congress or various state and local legislatures may enact such legislation or how such legislation might impact your Certificates. We are also unable to predict how changes by federal, state or local authorities to regulations currently in effect relating to assignee liability may affect your Certificates. Certificateholders will bear the risk that future regulatory and legal developments will result in losses on their Certificates, to the extent not covered by the applicable credit enhancement. The effect on the Certificates will likely be more severe if any of these future legal and regulatory developments occur in one or more states in which there is a significant concentration of Mortgaged Properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">On February 9, 2012, the Department of Justice, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and attorneys general representing 49 states and the District of Columbia reached a $25 billion settlement agreement (the “<b>Global Settlement</b>”) with five large mortgage servicers relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages. The Global Settlement, which became effective on April 5, 2012, required these servicers to dedicate at least $10 billion to reducing principal for mortgagors who, as of the date of the settlement, owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth and are either delinquent or at imminent risk of default. At least $3 billion will be used to establish a refinancing program for mortgagors who are current on their mortgages but who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, and up to $7 billion will be used to provide other forms of relief for certain mortgagors. In addition, a $1.5 billion mortgagor payment fund will be established to provide cash payments to certain mortgagors whose homes were sold or taken in foreclosure and who meet other criteria. These servicers are also required to pay an additional $3.5 billion to state and federal governments. It is uncertain whether principal reductions and monetary and other relief for mortgagors provided for under the settlement will be made available for mortgage loans in RMBS transactions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The servicers subject to the Global Settlement also agreed to implement extensive new servicing standards including, among other servicing practices, making foreclosure a last resort, by requiring the servicers to evaluate homeowners for other loan mitigation options first and restricting banks from foreclosing while the homeowner is being considered for a loan modification. The settlement does not prevent federal authorities and state attorneys general from pursuing criminal enforcement actions, various securities claims, and penalties and recoveries for losses in connection with government-insured or government-guaranteed loans. The settlement does not prevent any claims by individual mortgagors who wish to bring their own lawsuits. It appears that these servicing standards will apply to all residential mortgage loans serviced by the servicers who are party to the settlement. Moreover, it is anticipated that federal regulators will seek to establish regulations imposing similar servicing standards on all servicers of residential mortgage loans.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stricter Enforcement of Foreclosure Rules and Documentation Requirements May Cause Delays and Increase the Risk of Loss</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Recently courts and administrative agencies have been enforcing more strictly existing rules regarding the conduct of foreclosures, and in some circumstances have been imposing new rules regarding foreclosures. Some courts have delayed or prohibited foreclosures based on alleged failures to comply with technical requirements. The Illinois Supreme Court has established new rules that provide mortgagors with additional protections against perceived foreclosure abuses. State legislatures have been enacting new laws regarding foreclosure procedures. In some cases, law enforcement personnel have been refusing to enforce foreclosure judgments. In addition, more mortgagors are using legal actions, including filing for bankruptcy, to attempt to block or delay foreclosures. As a result, the Servicer may be subject to delays in conducting foreclosures and the expense of foreclosures may increase, resulting in delays or reductions in distributions on the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Mortgagors have become increasingly successful in challenging or delaying foreclosures based on technical grounds, including challenges based on alleged defects in the mortgage loan documents and challenges based on alleged defects in the documents under which the Mortgage Loans were securitized. In a number of cases, such challenges have delayed or prevented foreclosures. Although the Custodian has conducted a review of the mortgage documents in accordance with Custody Agreement, such measures may not be sufficient to prevent document defects that could cause delays or prevent a foreclosure. It is possible that there will be an increase in the number of successful challenges to foreclosures by mortgagors. Curing defective documents required to conduct a foreclosure will cause delays and increase costs, resulting in losses on the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Proposals to Acquire Mortgage Loans by Eminent Domain May Adversely Affect Your Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In 2012 and 2013, certain cities in California and Nevada explored offering to acquire mortgage loans at city-determined fair market values or through eminent domain and to modify or refinance these mortgage loans to allow homeowners to continue to own and occupy their homes. The price to be paid for such mortgage loans was unclear, but such price would likely be less than the outstanding principal balance of a mortgage loan and may be significantly less. These programs generally contemplated that any such refinancing will be accomplished using a federally guaranteed  loan, which can readily  be  resold, thus minimizing any cash outlay  by the governmental entity. Federal appropriations legislation for the past several years, however, prohibits the use of appropriated funds to insure or refinance a mortgage loan that has been subject to eminent domain, condemnation or seizure. In the absence of access to federally guaranteed loans, it would be very difficult for a governmental entity to operate such an eminent domain program without making substantial cash outlays. It is also likely that any such action by a government entity without the consent of the owner of the mortgage loan would face legal challenge. To the extent a government entity were to successfully operate such a program, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market value of residential mortgage-backed securities such as the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">More recently, former President Trump and others have argued for an eminent domain program to secure land to build a border fence at the United States border with Mexico. Prior legislation in 2006 to construct limited fencing on the border used eminent domain but resulted in extensive litigation and delays. It is uncertain if any future legislation would utilize eminent domain in connection with border security.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">As described under  “<i>The Pooling and  Servicing Agreement—Obligations  in Respect of Proposed Eminent Domain Mortgage Loan Acquisition,</i>” if a governmental entity implements a program under which it has the power to acquire residential mortgage loans through the exercise of eminent domain, and the governmental entity proposes to acquire a mortgage loan out of the Issuing Entity, the Controlling Representative, if it receives notice of such action, will be obligated (i) to cause the Servicer to obtain a valuation on the related property in the form of a broker’s price opinion or another valuation method that it deems appropriate, and (ii) provide written notice to the Paying Agent of the governmental entity’s proposed action. Upon receipt of notice thereof from the Controlling Representative, the Paying Agent will make available to Certificateholders such notice of the governmental entity’s proposed action. A quorum of Certificateholders may direct the Trustee on behalf of the Issuing Entity to pursue an action contesting the acquisition through appropriate legal proceedings. These procedures may take substantial time, which could result in delays in collections of amounts due on the Mortgage Loans, increased costs and losses to Certificateholders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Environmental Conditions Affecting Mortgaged Properties May Result in Losses</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">To the extent the Servicer acquires title to any Mortgaged Property related to a Mortgage Loan that is contaminated with or affected by hazardous wastes or hazardous substances, such Mortgage Loans may incur</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">losses. See “<i>Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Environmental Considerations</i>” in this Offering Memorandum. To the extent these environmental risks result in losses on the Mortgage Loans, the yield to maturity of the Offered Certificates, to the extent not covered by credit enhancement, may be affected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Insurance Related to the Mortgaged Properties May Not Be Sufficient to Compensate for Losses</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Although the Mortgaged Properties may be covered by insurance policies, such as hazard insurance or flood insurance, no assurance can be made that the proceeds from such policies will be used to repay any amounts owed in respect of such Mortgage Loan or will be used to make improvements to the Mortgaged Property that have a value that is commensurate with the value of any of the damaged improvements. In addition, even though an insurance policy may cover the “replacement cost” of the improvements on any Mortgaged Property, the proceeds of such insurance policy may not be sufficient to cover the actual replacement cost of such improvements or the Appraised Value of the improvements on any Mortgaged Property. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the insurer related to any insurance policy will have sufficient financial resources to make any payment on any insurance policy or that any such insurer will not challenge any claim made with respect to any such insurance policy resulting in a delay or reduction of the ultimate insurance proceeds.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Potential Conflicts of Interest Relating to the Initial Purchasers</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Initial Purchasers may from time to time perform investment banking and other financing related services for, or solicit investment banking and other financing related business from, any person named in this Offering Memorandum and/or certain of their affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and/or their employees or customers may from time to time have a long or short position in the Certificates. These long or short positions may be as a result of any market making activities with respect to the Certificates. The Initial Purchasers and/or their employees or customers may from time to time enter into hedging positions with respect to the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">It is expected that the Sponsor will use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Purchased Certificates to the Initial Purchasers to pay off a portion of amounts owed by Angel Oak Parties under secured financing facilities maintained with one or more of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates. Proceeds of the offering of the Certificates will be used by the Sponsor, in part, to pay off such financing facilities. If a default (including a cross-default) or margin deficit occurs under any such financing facility with an Angel Oak Party in the future, such Angel Oak Party may seek a waiver of such default or margin deficit, as the case may be, but the lender under such financing facility may decide in its sole discretion not to grant the waiver or to exercise remedies available to it. At the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, lenders under such financing facilities to the Angel Oak Parties provided certain limited waivers in respect of such financing facilities and such waivers have expired and the related underlying defaults are no longer outstanding as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. No lender to any Angel Oak Party is under any obligation to continue providing waivers in connection with any future defaults. Should a lender to an Angel Oak Party choose to exercise remedies upon a default or margin deficit, it could have a material and adverse effect on the applicable Angel Oak Party’s liquidity, financial condition or ability to perform its obligations under the transaction documents. No Initial Purchaser nor any affiliate of any Initial Purchaser (as lender under such financing facilities) has any obligation to act in the best interests of the Certificateholders or to take the Certificateholders’ interests into account when deciding whether to grant waivers, exercise remedies or take any other actions in connection with any such financing facility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Potential Conflicts of Interest Relating to the Angel Oak Originators, the Sponsor, the Seller, the Representation Provider, the Depositor, the Servicing Administrator and the Certificateholders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Angel Oak Originators, the Representation Provider, the Sponsor, the Seller, the Depositor and the Servicing Administrator are affiliates. The Sponsor or a Majority-Owned Affiliate will retain for risk retention purposes a portion of the Class B-X Certificates and the Sponsor and its affiliates will initially retain the Class B- 2 Certificates, the Class A-IO-S Certificates and the remaining portion of the Class B-X Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">There may be conflicts of interest between the initial majority owner of the Offered Certificates and the holders of the Purchased Certificates due to differing priorities of distribution and payment terms. The holder of a majority percentage interest of the Class B-X Certificates will have the ability to appoint the Controlling Representative. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides that the Controlling Representative will have certain direction, consent and waiver rights. Potential conflicts between the Controlling Representative and the holders of the Offered Certificates may result because the initial Controlling Representative is an affiliate of the Representation Provider, the Angel Oak Originators and the Servicing Administrator. The Controlling Representative is not a fiduciary for the Certificateholders.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Investors in the Certificates should consider that certain voting and other decisions may not be in the best interests of each class of Certificateholders and that any conflict of interest among different Certificateholders may not be resolved in favor of investors in a particular class of Certificates. Any disputes that arise between Certificateholders may not be resolved without substantial delay, which may cause delays in distribution on the Offered Certificates. The economic interests of the holders of a class of Certificates may not other coincide with those of other holders of the same class or holders of other classes of Certificates. The holders of Certificates will not be required to consider any possible adverse effect of their actions on other holders of the same class or holders of other classes of Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Ratings on the Offered Certificates Are Not a Recommendation to Buy, Sell or Hold the Offered Certificates and are Subject to Withdrawal at any Time, Which May Result in Losses on the Offered Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">It is a condition to the issuance of the Offered Certificates that the Offered Certificates be rated at least as high as the ratings set forth in the Certificates Tables. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. No person is obligated to maintain the rating on any Offered Certificate, and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that the ratings assigned to any Offered Certificate on the Closing Date will not be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency at any time thereafter, including as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. In the event any rating is revised or withdrawn, the liquidity or the market value of the related Offered Certificates may be adversely affected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The ratings of the Offered Certificates depend primarily on an assessment of the Mortgage Loans, the credit enhancement provided to the Offered Certificates and the ability of the Servicer to service the Mortgage Loans. Rating agencies rate mortgage-backed securities based upon their assessment of the likelihood of the receipt of principal and interest payments. Rating agencies do not consider the risks of fluctuations in market value or other factors that may influence the value of mortgage-backed securities and, therefore, the assigned credit rating may not fully reflect the true risks of an investment in the Offered Certificates. Credit rating agencies may change their methods of evaluating credit risk and determining ratings on securities backed by mortgage loans as well as their methodologies and requirements for establishing the credit enhancement to achieve certain ratings. These changes may occur quickly and often. Currently, Fitch is evaluating the impact on the COVID-19 outbreak on its credit enhancement requirements, which may result in a downgrade of some or all of the Rated Certificates at any time. Potential investors in the Offered Certificates should make their own evaluation of the creditworthiness of the Mortgage Loans and the applicable credit enhancement on such Offered Certificates, and potential investors should not rely on the ratings assigned by any rating agency to any of the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The ratings of the Offered Certificates by a rating agency only address the likelihood of receipt by holders of such Certificates of distributions in the amount of scheduled payments on the Mortgage Loans. They do not take into consideration any of the tax aspects associated with the Offered Certificates. The ratings do not address the possibility that, as a result of principal prepayments, the yield on your Offered Certificates may be lower than anticipated. The ratings do not comment as to market price, marketability or suitability of the Offered Certificates for any particular investor (including any accounting and/or regulatory treatment). Rating agencies rely on the accuracy and completeness of the data, reports and information provided to them in connection with the assignment of a credit rating, and the rating agencies have no duty to (and generally do not) verify or audit such data, reports and information. In addition, rating agencies disclaim that they are “experts” for any purpose, including under any securities laws. Investors in the Offered Certificates should note that the ratings of the Offered Certificates are not a guaranty of the value of the Mortgaged Properties related to the Mortgage Loans and Certificateholders may incur losses regardless of their rating. See “<i>Ratings</i>” in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the Securities and Exchange Commission may determine that any one or more of the rating agencies engaged by the Sponsor no longer qualifies as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or is no longer qualified to rate the Offered Certificates. Any such determination may adversely affect the liquidity, market value and regulatory characteristics of your Rated Certificates, and you may not be able to sell or obtain financing for your Offered Certificates, or you may be able to sell only at a substantial discount from the price you paid or obtain financing at interest rates in excess of current interest rates. No entity will be required to obtain a substitute rating from another rating agency.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Additional Ratings of the Offered Certificates or a Withdrawal of the Ratings May Adversely Affect Their Value and/or Limit Your Ability to Sell Your Offered Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Sponsor has hired Fitch and KBRA (each, a “<b>Hired NRSRO</b>”) and will pay each Hired NRSRO a fee to assign ratings on all or a portion of the Rated Certificates.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Sponsor has not hired any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization (a “<b>Non-Hired NRSRO</b>”) to assign ratings on all or a portion of the Certificates. However, under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, information provided to the Hired NRSROs for the purpose of assigning or monitoring the ratings on the Rated Certificates is required to be made available to any Non-Hired NRSRO in order to make it possible for such Non-Hired NRSRO to assign unsolicited ratings on one or more classes of Certificates. An unsolicited rating could be assigned at any time, including prior to the Closing Date, and none of the Sponsor, the Seller, the Depositor, the Initial Purchasers or any of their affiliates will have any obligation to inform you of any unsolicited ratings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Rating agencies, including the Hired NRSROs, have different methodologies, criteria, models and requirements. If any Non-Hired NRSRO assigns an unsolicited rating on one or more classes of the Offered Certificates (or issues other commentary on one or more classes of the Offered Certificates), there can be no assurance that such rating will not be lower than the ratings provided by the Hired NRSROs (or that the commentary will not imply a lower rating), which could adversely affect the market value of your Offered Certificates and/or limit your ability to sell your Offered Certificates. In addition, if the Sponsor fails to make available on an internet website to the Non-Hired NRSROs any information provided to the Hired NRSROs for the purpose of assigning or monitoring the ratings on the Rated Certificates, a Hired NRSRO could withdraw its ratings on your Offered Certificates, which could adversely affect the market value of your Offered Certificates and/or limit your ability to sell your Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Certain Statistical Information Included in this Offering Memorandum Is Based on Limited Verification and May Change After the Closing Date</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certain statistical information included in this Offering Memorandum is based on information that has been verified solely pursuant to the processes described herein. For example, information about owner occupancy is based primarily upon a representation made by the mortgagor in connection with the mortgagor’s loan application. Limited procedures, if any, may have been taken by the related Originator to verify this representation prior to the closing of the Mortgage Loan. Except with respect to the Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loans, there was no visit to the related Mortgaged Property or any other sort of diligence performed after the Mortgage Loan was originated by the Originator or any other party to ensure that the Mortgaged Property was occupied as the mortgagor indicated. With respect to the Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loans, the applicable Securitization Diligence Provider conducted limited diligence to mitigate the risk of mortgagor occupancy, but there can be no assurance that the applicable Securitization Diligence Provider’s pre-offering review uncovered all instances of mortgagor occupancy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Information about loan-to-value ratios included in this Offering Memorandum is based in part upon appraisals obtained when the Mortgage Loan was originated. As described in this Offering Memorandum, these appraisals are of limited value in determining the value of the related Mortgaged Property. The information in this Offering Memorandum regarding loan-to-value ratios does not represent the actual value of the Mortgaged Property, only the value expressed in an appraisal obtained in connection with the origination of the Mortgage Loan, or a lower value if it was determined by the Sponsor that such lower value was warranted. See “—<i>Loan-to- Value Ratios Are Calculated Based on Appraised Value or Sales Price, Which May Not Be an Accurate Reflection of Current Market Value</i>” above. In addition, the values of the Mortgaged Properties may have declined significantly since the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Investors should note that the statistical information included in this Offering Memorandum presented on a weighted average basis or any statistic based on the Scheduled Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date is subject to a variance of plus or minus 5%.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, the characteristics of the Mortgage Loans may change over time. For example, with respect to owner occupancy, a mortgagor may move his or her primary residence to another location, as a result of a job transfer or otherwise, and rent the Mortgaged Property related to the Mortgage Loan. Moreover, the creditworthiness of the mortgagors will change over time, and any related information included in this Offering Memorandum, such as credit scores, may be different at any future date from the time it was obtained.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Mortgagors who are able to maintain their creditworthiness over time will have a greater ability to refinance their mortgage loan or to obtain a new mortgage loan in the event they want to sell their home and move to a new mortgaged property, in each case resulting in a prepayment of their existing mortgage loan. As a result, the overall credit quality of the mortgagors for the Mortgage Loans included in the Mortgage Pool may decline over time if these mortgagors prepay more quickly than the other mortgagors.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Weighted Average Lives of Your Offered Certificates May Differ from the Weighted Average Lives Shown in the Sensitivity Tables and Could Adversely Affect the Return on Your Offered Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The sensitivity tables set forth in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared on the basis of the Structuring Assumptions described under “<i>Prepayment and Yield Considerations</i>” in this Offering Memorandum. The model used in this Offering Memorandum for prepayments also does not purport to be an historical description of prepayment experience or a prediction of the anticipated rate of prepayment of any pool of mortgage loans, including the Mortgage Loans. It is highly unlikely that the Mortgage Loans will prepay at any of the rates specified or that the Mortgage Loans will have no delinquencies or losses. The assumed percentages of CPR and assumption of no delinquencies and losses are for illustrative purposes only. See “<i>Prepayment and Yield Consideration</i>” in this Offering Memorandum for a description of CPR. The actual rates of prepayment or performance of the Mortgage Loans may not correspond to any of the assumptions made in this Offering Memorandum. For these reasons, the weighted average lives of your Offered Certificates may differ from the weighted average lives shown in the sensitivity tables and could adversely affect the return on your Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are Additional Risks in Holding the Class B-X Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Prior to any purchase of the Class B-X Certificates, consider the following factors relating to the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution that may adversely impact your yield:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l21"><li><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">The Class B-X Certificates are the most subordinated class of Offered Certificates and may only receive distributions of the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution if Monthly Excess Cashflow is available therefor, after the P&amp;I Certificates (including the Class B-X Certificates) have been reimbursed for Applied Realized Loss Amounts, an amount up to the amount of any Realized Losses in the related Prepayment Period have been distributed to such classes and after any required deposits to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account. There can be no assurance that Monthly Excess Cashflow will be available for any Distribution Date and any Monthly Excess Cashflow is highly dependent on interest collections on the Mortgage Pool exceeding the amounts needed to pay fees and expenses (including amounts distributed to the Class A-IO-S Certificates) and to distribute to the P&amp;I Certificates (including the Class B-X Certificates) any Interest Distribution Amount and Interest Carryforward Amount thereon.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">The Class B-X Certificates have an obligation to pay interest that they would otherwise receive as the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account up to the Cap Carryover Amounts for the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class M-1 and Class B-1 Certificates. Such amounts paid to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account will permanently reduce the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution distributable on the Class B-X Certificates. Any amounts so distributed will accrue to the Class B-X Certificates for U.S. federal income tax purposes with no corresponding cash payment. Potential Investors in the Class B-X Certificates should consult their tax advisors concerning a potential investment in the Class B-X Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">If the Depositor exercises its Optional Redemption right or the Servicer exercises its Optional Termination right, the transaction will terminate. If the transaction is terminated via a redemption, the Class B-X Certificates will not receive any amounts in respect of their Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution on redemption even though such Certificates would have accrued taxable income in respect of such unpaid Class B- X Additional Monthly Distribution.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">You should fully consider the risks of investing in a Class B-X Certificate relating to the distribution of the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution described in this Offering Memorandum, such as the extreme sensitivity of the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution to prepayments on the Mortgage Loans, including liquidations and defaults, changes in the Net WAC Rate, repurchases, redemption or termination of the transaction by the Depositor and other factors that could affect the yield on the Class B-X Certificates and could result in your failure to fully recover your initial investment. Also, investors in the Class B-X Certificates are highly encouraged to review the disclosures under “<i>Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences</i>” in order to understand the U.S. federal income tax consequences of investing in the Class B-X Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are Additional Risks in Holding the Class A-IO-S Certificates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Distributions on the Class A-IO-S Certificates will be highly dependent on the size of the Excess Servicing Strip for each Distribution Date. Prepayments on the Mortgage Loans resulting in Compensating Interest Payments will adversely affect the Excess Servicing Strip. On the other hand, prepayments on the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mortgage Loans resulting in Prepayment Interest Excess in excess of Prepayment Interest Shortfalls on such Mortgage Loans may result in greater distributions on the Class A-IO-S Certificates. The Excess Servicing Strip will also be highly dependent on the extent the Gross Administration Fees on the Mortgage Loans as such fees vary depending on the loan program under which such Mortgage Loans were originated. To the extent the mix of Mortgage Loans changes such that overall Gross Administration Fees decrease, the yield on the Class A-IO-S Certificates will be adversely affected. Additionally, to the extent the overall amount of Servicing Fees on the Mortgage Loans increases due to the performance of the Mortgage Pool or a servicing transfer results in an increase in Servicing Fees on the Mortgage Loans, the yield on the Class A-IO-S Certificates will be adversely affected and could be eliminated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If the Depositor exercises its Optional Redemption right or the Servicer exercises its Optional Termination right, the transaction will terminate and the Class A-IO-S Certificates will not receive a distribution upon termination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">You should fully consider the risks of investing in the Class A-IO-S Certificates the risk that you may not fully recover your initial investment. Also, investors in the Class A-IO-S Certificates are highly encouraged to review the disclosures under “<i>Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences</i>” in order to understand the U.S. federal income tax consequences of investing in the Class A-IO-S Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Cyber-attacks or Other Security Breaches Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business of the Sponsor, Its Affiliates, the Servicer and the Originators</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In the normal course of business, the Sponsor, its affiliates, the Servicer and the Originators collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential information. Although the Sponsor, its affiliates, the Servicer and the Originators devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of their systems through information security and business continuity programs, their facilities and systems, and those of their third-party service providers, are vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, or other similar events. In addition, due to the transition to remote working environments as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, there is an elevated risk of such events occurring. See “—<i>The COVID-19 Outbreak May Adversely Affect the Performance, Liquidity and Market Value of the Offered Certificates</i>” in this Offering Memorandum. These events could interrupt the business or operations of the Sponsor, its affiliates, the Servicer or the Originators, result in significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to the reputation of the Sponsor, its affiliates, the Servicer or the Originators or a loss of confidence in the security of the systems, products and services of the Sponsor, its affiliates, the Servicer or the Originators. Although the impact to date from these types of events has not had a material adverse effect on the Sponsor, its affiliates, the Servicer or the Originators, it cannot be assured that this will be the case in the future. Information security risks for organizations like the Sponsor, its affiliates, the Servicer and the Originators have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile and other connected devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against organizations that are designed to disrupt key business services. The Sponsor’s, its affiliates’, the Servicer’s and the Originators’ successful business performance and marketing efforts may increase their profile and therefore their risk of being targeted for cyber- attacks and other security breaches, including attacks targeting key business services. The Sponsor, its affiliates, the Servicer and the Originators are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. The access by unauthorized persons to, or the improper disclosure by the Sponsor, its affiliates, the Servicer or the Originators of, confidential information regarding their customers or their own proprietary information, software, methodologies and business secrets could interrupt the Sponsor’s, its affiliates’, the Servicer’s or the Originators’ business or operations, result in significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to their reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of their systems, products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on their business, financial condition and results of operations and the servicing of the Mortgage Loans. Cyber-attacks or other breaches, whether affecting the Sponsor, its affiliates, the Servicer, the Originators or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Sponsor’s, its affiliates’, the Servicer’s or the Originators’ businesses. If the business of the Sponsor or any of its affiliates is materially adversely affected by such events, the Sponsor may not be able to fulfill its obligation to cure or repurchase the related Mortgage Loans following breaches of its representations and warranties. If the business of the Servicer</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is materially adversely affected by such events, the Servicer may not be able to fulfill its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Combination or “Layering” of Multiple Risk Factors May Significantly Increase Your Risk of Loss</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Although the various risks discussed in this Offering Memorandum are generally described separately, prospective investors in the Offered Certificates should consider the potential effects of the interplay of multiple risk factors. Where more than one significant risk factor is present, the risk of loss to an investor may be significantly increased. For example, the Mortgage Pool may include Mortgage Loans that not only have relatively high loan-to-value ratios but also may have other features such as lower FICO scores or are cash-out refinancings. Certain of these Mortgage Loans are secured by properties in regions that are experiencing home price depreciation. There are many other circumstances in which layering of multiple risks with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the Offered Certificates may magnify the effect of those risks. In considering the potential effects of layered risks, you should carefully review the descriptions of the Mortgage Loans and the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This Offering Memorandum Contains Summary and Limited Information Regarding the Transaction Documents and the Mortgage Loans</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">This Offering Memorandum contains summary descriptions of certain documents, including the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, which govern the transactions described herein, and of the statutes, rules and regulations applicable to the Mortgage Loans.

The order, while recognizing that AOCP did not admit or deny any findings, concluded that AOCP operated as a broker-dealer from March 2010 until October 2014 without registering with the SEC. The SEC found that AOCP entered into an agreement with Peraza Capital &amp; Investment, LLC (“<b>Peraza</b>”) in late 2009 for the purpose of conducting a securities business, without registering as a broker-dealer. Traders employed by AOCP in its securities business were registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority as registered representatives of Peraza, and AOCP and Peraza split the commission revenue generated as a result of AOCP trading activities. The SEC determined that AOCP and its owners or employees—who were not registered as broker-dealers or associated with a registered broker-dealer—were involved in the operations of the securities business and made key decisions regarding the business. As reflected in the order, the SEC accepted AOCP’s offer to disgorge profits received from the operation of $3,054,288 plus interest, to pay a penalty of $375,000 and to cease and desist from that activity. The SEC further accepted an offer of settlement from Sreeniwas Prabhu and an employee of AOCA, based on the allegations of the SEC that they caused AOCP to operate as an unregistered broker dealer. They both agreed to a cease and desist order and an administrative penalty of $40,000 each.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">THE SPONSOR</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Angel Oak Real Estate Investment Trust II (the “<b>Sponsor</b>”) is a Maryland real estate investment trust and was formed on June 15, 2018.

Amounts included for contractually current bankruptcies for the total servicing portfolio for December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021 are $827 (millions) and $805 (millions) respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SPS’s Policies and Procedures</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The following summary describes certain of SPS’s relevant and current servicing operations and procedures and is included for informational purposes. SPS expects that from time to time its servicing operations and procedures will be modified and changed to address applicable legal and regulatory developments, as well as other economic and social factors that impact its servicing operations and procedures. There can be no assurance, and no representation is made, that the general servicing operations and procedures of SPS described below will apply to each Mortgage Loan in the Mortgage Pool during the term of such Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">SPS posts mortgage loan payments on a daily basis. Funds are typically posted to a payment clearing account on the business day they are received. SPS transfers funds from the payment clearing account to individual custodial accounts within two business days of deposit into the payment clearing account.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">SPS uses two methods of determining delinquencies, depending on whether the related servicing agreement requires (expressly or by implication) application of the “MBA delinquency method” or the “OTS delinquency method.” The MBA delinquency method treats a loan as 30-59 days delinquent when a payment is contractually past due 30 to 59 days. For example, a loan due on the first of the month is considered 30 days delinquent at close of business on the last day of the same month. The OTS delinquency method includes a one month grace period for the purpose of reporting delinquencies. This method treats a loan as 30-59 days delinquent when a payment is contractually past due 60 to 89 days. For example, a loan due on the first of the month is considered 30 days delinquent at close of business on the last day of the following month.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">SPS uses equity valuation and management experience to determine the point at which an asset should be charged off, unless different criteria are called for by the related servicing agreement. This evaluation considers the length of the delinquency, time elapsed since the last contact with the customer, any loss of security to the property, and the projected economic valuation of the asset. SPS uses multiple methods for determining the point of charge off, depending on the lien position of the related asset.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">All SPS employees responsible for collection efforts are fully trained in all the loss mitigation solutions that SPS offers its borrowers (reinstatement, repayment plan, forbearance plan, loan modification, short sale, deed- in-lieu, and deferral) and use the same system, tools, and technology.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Based on loan specific risk scores, customer calling campaigns may start as early as the first day of delinquency and continue until the default has been resolved. SPS has a high degree of flexibility in structuring outbound customer calling campaigns to manage collection efforts and maximize loss mitigation efforts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SPS also utilizes letter campaigns to contact customers who may be candidates for workout options.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">All collections employees receive specialized training in various loss mitigation strategies and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. These employees are trained to identify potential causes for delinquency. Once contact with the customer is established, the staff will attempt to determine the customer’s willingness and ability to pay using a proprietary loss mitigation model developed by SPS. SPS evaluates all loss mitigation options available to its customers consistent with applicable regulations and servicing agreement requirements. These options may include reinstatement, repayment plan, forbearance agreement, loan modification, deferral, short sale, and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In connection with handling delinquencies, losses, bankruptcies and recoveries, SPS has developed a model, based upon updated property values, for projecting the anticipated net recovery on each asset. Property valuations are generally ordered starting at the 63rd day of the default recovery process of the delinquent loan and then at least every six months thereafter. The frequency of valuations may increase based on loss mitigation activity, foreclosure sale bid processing, or stop advance decisions. The projected “net present value” is part of SPS’s proprietary loss mitigation automation and assists staff with determining an appropriate and reasonable strategy to resolve each defaulted loan on the basis of the information then available. For junior lien loans, SPS tracks the status and outstanding balances of any senior liens and incorporates this information into the model.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Before SPS refers any loan to foreclosure (or resumes foreclosure activity after a delay), the loan undergoes an extensive audit to ensure compliance with all state and federal laws and regulations, ensure that each loan has exhausted loss mitigation opportunities if the customer has a hardship, and identify any potential servicing errors or disputes. SPS utilizes automation tools to identify new bankruptcy filings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">SPS is responsible for property marketing and disposition, and coordinates property valuations, property inspections, and preservation work. Once a property has been acquired as REO and is in possession, a minimum of two property valuations are obtained to determine the asset value. All valuations are reviewed and reconciled by valuation specialists prior to listing the property. These specialists set the suggested sales price and make recommendations for property repairs. SPS asset managers have delegated approval to accept offers within pre- defined authority levels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">SPS has internal control governance to ensure that company policies and procedures are followed and that SPS operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations. These include internal audits and compliance testing reviews conducted independent of loan servicing departments, reporting of audit and test results, and undertaking corrective action as appropriate. SPS has a risk assessment process wherein all loan servicing departments are responsible for identifying operational and financial risks and implementing and documenting controls relative to the identified risks, which process is reported and approved on an ongoing basis. The entire program is overseen by the senior management team.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">SPS is not the document custodian of most of the loans that it services. SPS has an internal department which manages all document requests from staff and vendors. The Document Control department works closely with the foreclosure and bankruptcy units and with third party custodians to clear assignments and document exceptions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In connection with the servicing of mortgage loans, SPS outsources certain tasks and business processes related to the following loan servicing functions to companies within the United States:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l23"><li><p style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">Some print and mail services</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">Title processing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">Tax payments and processing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">Insurance payments and claims processing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">Flood zone determination and tracking</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">Property preservation and valuation services</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, SPS typically outsources certain non-customer contact tasks and business processes related to certain loan servicing functions to an outsourcing company operating in India.

The sale to Computershare closed on November 1, 2021, and virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare Trust Company and CDTC, as applicable, as part of the sale. On November 1, 2021, for some of the transactions in its CTS business, Wells Fargo transferred its roles, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant transaction agreements to Computershare Trust Company and CDTC, as applicable. For other transactions in its CTS business, Wells Fargo intends to transfer such roles, duties, rights, and liabilities to Computershare Trust Company or CDTC, as applicable, in stages after November 1, 2021. For any transaction where Wells Fargo’s roles did not transfer to Computershare Trust Company or CDTC on November 1, 2021, Computershare Trust Company or CDTC performs all or virtually all of Wells Fargo’s obligations as its agent as of such date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Wells Fargo Bank will act as Master Servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

Wells Fargo Bank may, in some limited circumstances, retain performance of certain of its duties as Master Servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. In those limited circumstances, Computershare Trust Company as agent for Wells Fargo Bank would not perform such duties.

Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Wells Fargo Bank previously settled two class action lawsuits with similar allegations that were filed in November 2014 and December 2016 by institutional investors in the Southern District of New York and New York state court, respectively. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Park Royal II LLC have filed complaints in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective mortgage loan documentation.

In the underlying first-party actions, Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with residential mortgage- backed securities sponsored by them. In the third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo Bank, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and failed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that Wells Fargo Bank failed to perform default oversight duties. Wells Fargo Bank has asserted counterclaims alleging that Nomura and Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo Bank notice of their representation and warranty breaches.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">With respect to each of the foregoing litigations, Wells Fargo Bank believes plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and intends to contest the claims vigorously, but there can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigations or the possible impact of the litigations on Wells Fargo Bank or the related residential mortgage backed securities trusts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 (the “<b>Period</b>”), furnished pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB by the CTS division of Wells Fargo Bank for its RMBS master servicing platform (the “<b>2020 Wells Fargo CTS RMBS Master Servicing Assessment</b>”), disclosed that a material instance of noncompliance occurred with respect to the servicing criterion set forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(v) of Regulation AB.

The 2020 Wells Fargo CTS RMBS Master Servicing Assessment further states that such custodial accounts did not satisfy account eligibility requirements because (i) Wells Fargo Bank’s, or its holding company’s, as applicable, long-term and/or short- term issuer ratings during the Period were lower than the related ratings thresholds required by the transaction agreements for such transactions, and (ii) there was no alternative means during the Period to satisfy account eligibility requirements for such transactions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The 2020 Wells Fargo CTS RMBS Master Servicing Assessment states that Wells Fargo Bank is currently pursuing corrective action to remediate account eligibility noncompliance for any affected transactions in the RMBS master servicing platform.

AOHL also requires independent documentation as part of its underwriting process, including a credit report from an independent, nationally recognized credit reporting company, a third-party appraisal of the related subject property and other asset and income verification documentation. Licensed mortgage advisors obtain and review each mortgage loan application and other required documentation for completeness, price the mortgage loan and prequalify the mortgage loan.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Loan Setup. <span class="p">Once a mortgage loan has been prequalified by a licensed mortgage advisor, a member of AOHL’s Disclosure Team reviews the mortgage loan application and supporting documentation to ensure compliance with Federal and state law, inclusive of adherence to TRID policy and procedures, and certain internal and investor underwriting requirements. The Disclosure Team issues federally required disclosures, including the initial Loan Estimate, to the mortgagor within the required regulatory timeframe. Any subsequent re-disclosures of the Loan Estimate are triggered to the disclosure team, who will assess the file for applicable changes in circumstance and issue revised Loan Estimates accordingly. The pre-processing team also orders a third-party appraisal of the related subject property, initial fraud and verification reports and evaluates minimum submission standards. The licensed mortgage advisor is notified of any missing minimum standards that are required prior to submission of the loan application to the Client Advocate for review.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;"><i>Underwriting and Processing. </i>The client advocate (“<b>Client Advocate</b>”) reviews the mortgage loan file to ensure that all critical components have been completed, that each appraisal delivery complies with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and that all required compliance and fraud reports have been completed.

AOHL underwriters either grant a conditional approval on the terms requested, provide a counteroffer approval on the best terms AOHL is willing to offer the mortgagor, or deny the application.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In the course of their review, AOHL underwriters review the output of an automated underwriting system to ensure that the mortgagor does not meet the requirements for agency loan approval. Mortgage loan approvals are granted only by internal AOHL underwriting personnel with a minimum of seven years of experience. AOHL does not delegate underwriting authority to any broker or third-party. AOHL’s underwriters have an average of 16 years of experience.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Once a mortgage loan receives a conditional approval or counteroffer approval, the loan is returned to a Client Advocate to process the mortgage loan in accordance with the terms and conditions of the conditional approval or counteroffer approval, as applicable. The Client Advocate reviews the mortgage loan file to ensure that all critical components have been completed, that each appraisal delivery complies with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and that all required compliance and fraud reports have been completed. This includes assessment of all required TRID components to determine if a loan can be submitted for review of Closing Disclosure issuance. If all eligibility requirements have been met, the Client Advocate will trigger loan notification to the closing team, who is solely responsible for the issuance of the Closing Disclosure to the consumer. The Client Advocate returns the loan file to the AOHL underwriter to determine that the conditions specified in the conditional approval have all been met.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Prior to issuance of a final approval and authorization to close, the loan is submitted to the AOHL pre- funding quality control department and evaluated for compliance with Federal, state, and investor requirements. Such evaluation includes adherence with TRID requirements as well as regulatory timeframes for disclosure issuance. The loan documentation is evaluated for file integrity and an assessment of the mortgagor’s ability to repay (except with respect to mortgagors under the Angel Oak Non-Prime Foreign National Program and the Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Program). This includes an additional review of total income and obligations for loan qualification. Any deficiencies uncovered during the audit are addressed by an AOHL underwriter.

An extensive audit of all Loan Estimates and disclosure timeframes is completed. In addition, the closer reviews all fees in accordance with baseline tolerance thresholds and appropriately documents any fee variances. In conjunction with the TRID review, AOHL performs a comprehensive legal audit of each mortgage loan to ensure that all documentation is accurate and complies with federal and state law as well as with internal and investor requirements. The closing legal audit includes a review of title, lien and judgment searches, final compliance reports for APR and finance charge tolerance and MERS property ownership reports.

Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions LLC is a wholesale mortgage lender. AOMS utilizes a network of internally approved third-party originators (each, a “<b>TPO</b>”) to provide mortgage loans to mortgagors who generally do not meet standard Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines. AOMS has engaged Comergence Compliance Monitoring, LLC (“<b>Comergence</b>”) to facilitate the documentation process for the application, approval and review of TPOs. AOMS is solely responsible for the approval of a TPO. Every mortgage loan originated by AOMS is underwritten and reviewed for regulatory compliance by AOMS.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Loan Application. <span class="p">To ensure adherence with TRID disclosure requirements, AOMS controls the review and issuance of all initial Loan Estimates and applicable disclosures, with exception to approved correspondent clients who are permitted to issue their own disclosures, on behalf of the TPO. Therefore, following request of loan prequalification review, AOMS requires the TPO to submit application data within two business days of receipt. The TPO completes fee sheet data on the secure web portal and submits their request for initial disclosures. The compliance analyst reviews the initial file to ensure regulatory timeframes are met and that fees are compliant as requested. The compliance analyst will issue the Loan Estimate and initial disclosure package to the consumer, following validation of data entry for the Loan Estimate with the TPO. The TPO will then ensure the consumer signs all disclosures as applicable and collects any required loan submission documents. Approved Correspondent clients are permitted to issue their own disclosures. However, the accuracy of these disclosures are also audited by the compliance team prior to loan application acceptance. Each mortgage loan application package includes information with respect to the applicant’s liabilities, income, credit history, employment history and other personal information. AOMS also requires independent documentation as part of its underwriting process, including (except with respect to a foreign national) a credit report from an independent, nationally recognized credit reporting company, a third-party appraisal of the related subject property and other asset and income verification documentation.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;"><i>Loan Setup. </i>The AOMS loan setup team (the “<b>AOMS Loan Setup Team</b>”) reviews each mortgage loan application submitted by a TPO to ensure compliance with Federal and state laws and certain internal and investor underwriting requirements.

If all eligibility requirements have been met, the underwriting assistant will trigger loan notification to the closing team, who is solely responsible for the issuance of the Closing Disclosure to the consumer. The loan will be forwarded to the AOMS mortgage underwriter to review the remainder of the re-submission package. The loan is reviewed to ensure all critical components have been competed, that each appraisal complies with the requirements of Dodd-Frank Act and that all required compliance and fraud reports have been completed.

Pre-Funding Quality Control Auditors of AOHL reviewing files on behalf of AOMS have an average of 12 years of experience conducting forensic underwriting.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to identifying potential problems with an individual mortgage loan prior to closing and funding, quality assurance audits allow management to identify trends in the origination and underwriting process in order to institute appropriate system and workflow enhancements and develop employee training programs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Closing<span class="p">. The AOMS pre-closer and closer are the only roles approved to issue the Closing Disclosure to the consumer. The closing team completes a specialized review of the loan relative to TRID adherence. An extensive audit of all Loan Estimates and disclosure time frames is completed. In addition, the closing team reviews all fees in accordance with baseline tolerance thresholds and appropriately documents any fee variances. In conjunction with the TRID review, a comprehensive legal audit of each mortgage loan is performed to ensure that all documentation is accurate and complies with federal and state law as well as with internal and investor requirements. The closing legal audit includes a review of title, lien and judgment searches, final compliance reports for APR and finance charge tolerance and MERS property ownership reports. AOMS issues Closing Disclosure approvals and completes Closing Disclosure reconciliations. Finally, AOMS requires satisfactory review of critical executed documents prior to issuing authorization to disburse on wired funds.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mortgage Loan Products and Programs</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Mortgage Loans are “non-conforming” in that they may not conform to the maximum mortgage loan amounts and, in some cases, to the underwriting guidelines of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, particularly with respect to the credit history of the mortgagor. These non-conforming mortgage loans may not conform to or be insurable by the Federal Housing Administration and may be ineligible to be guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Descriptions of the various mortgage loan products and programs offered by the Angel Oak Originators are set forth below.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Angel Oak Bank Statement Program</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Bank Statement Program (the “<b>Angel Oak Bank Statement Program</b>”) is designed for a prime or near prime self-employed borrower who needs an alternative way to calculate their income. The typical borrower has been self-employed for a minimum of two years and utilizes 12 or 24 months of personal or business bank statements to calculate income based on cash flow from those accounts. A typical Angel Oak Bank Statement Program mortgagor may have a credit score that is lower than that required by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines or may have been subject to a bankruptcy or foreclosure not less than 24 months prior to origination. The Angel Oak Bank Statement Program also allows for mortgagors to qualify using the Angel Oak 1099 Program.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Effective generally on September 20, 2019, the Angel Oak Bank Statement Program was used to qualify all mortgagors whose income was calculated using 12 or 24 months of bank statements. Prior to that, such mortgagors were qualified under the Angel Oak Portfolio Select Program or Angel Oak Platinum Program.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Program</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Investor Cash Flow Program (the “<b>Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Program</b>”) is designed for real estate investors who are experienced in purchasing, renting and managing investment properties. Potential mortgagors have an established two year credit history and at least 24 months of clean housing payment history but are unable to obtain financing through conventional or governmental channels because they fail to satisfy the credit requirements of such programs or may be over the maximum number of properties allowed. Mortgagors are financing the properties solely for investment purposes, including, but not limited to (i) retaining the properties as a stabilized rental and (ii) monetizing the investment for capital gains purposes. Mortgagors are required to sign a certification at application which states that the properties are not owner occupied and are owned solely for investment purposes. Mortgagors are qualified based on a debt service coverage ratio (the market rent (on a monthly basis) if a lease is not in place for the related property (and, in certain instances, when a lease is in place)) divided by the sum of monthly principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and homeowners association dues (if applicable). Mortgage Loans originated under the Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Program (each, an “<b>Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loan</b>”) have a business purpose and are thus not covered by the ability to repay rules promulgated under the ATR Rules or the TRID rule.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Angel Oak Platinum Program</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Platinum Program (the “<b>Angel Oak Platinum Program</b>”) is designed for mortgagors who do not qualify for the Originators’ program for mortgagors with prime credit scores and excellent housing history. The product is designed for mortgagors that have prime or near prime credit scores but who are unable to obtain financing through conventional or governmental channels because they fail to satisfy the credit requirements or are self-employed and need alternate income calculations using 12 or 24 months of bank statements or the most recent Federal income tax return. A typical Angel Oak Platinum Program mortgagor may have a credit score that is lower than that required by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines or may have been subject to a bankruptcy or foreclosure not less than 48 months prior to closing. The Angel Oak Platinum Program also allows for mortgagors to qualify using the Angel Oak Asset Qualifier Program.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Angel Oak Portfolio Select Program</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Portfolio Select Program (the “<b>Angel Oak Portfolio Select Program</b>”) is designed for mortgagors who have near-prime credit scores but are unable to obtain financing through conventional or governmental channels because they fail to satisfy credit requirements or are self-employed and need an alternate income calculation using 12 or 24- months of bank statements or the most recent Federal income tax return to qualify. A typical Angel Oak Portfolio Select Program mortgagor may have a credit score that is lower than that required by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines or may have been subject to a bankruptcy or foreclosure not less than 24 months prior to origination. The Angel Oak Portfolio Select Program also allows for mortgagors to qualify using the Angel Oak Asset Qualifier Program.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Angel Oak Prime Jumbo Program</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Prime Jumbo Program (the “<b>Angel Oak Prime Jumbo Program</b>”) is designed for mortgagors that have prime credit scores and excellent housing history with no bankruptcy or foreclosure event in the 60 months prior to the loan closing date. The Angel Oak Prime Jumbo Program guidelines follow Appendix Q for income</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">documentation requirements. The program allows for an interest-only feature. The loan amounts will exceed the conforming loan limits set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and will also allow high balance conforming loan limits; however, these loans will conform to all posted guidelines for the Angel Oak Prime Jumbo Program. The Angel Oak Prime Jumbo Program is designed to finance luxury properties and homes in highly competitive real estate markets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Angel Oak Non-Prime Programs</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The non-prime mortgage loan products consist of mortgage loans originated under the Angel Oak Non- Prime General Program and the Angel Oak Non-Prime Foreign National Program (together, the “<b>Angel Oak Non- Prime Programs</b>”). These programs are designed for mortgagors who either (i) have been affected by negative credit events, (ii) have negative credit events, such as foreclosures, bankruptcies or short sales, (iii) are not residents of the United States or (iv) are real estate investors. These mortgagors generally cannot qualify for conventional or government financing due to the typical waiting periods of three to seven years associated with a negative credit event.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The non-prime general program (the “<b>Angel Oak Non-Prime General Program</b>”) is designed for mortgagors whose credit reports show multiple 30+ and/or 60+ day delinquencies on any reported debt in the past 12 months.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The non-prime foreign national program (the “<b>Angel Oak Non-Prime Foreign National Program</b>”) is designed for citizens of foreign countries who do not reside or work in the United States. The Angel Oak Non- Prime Foreign National Program only allows for investment properties. In addition, the Non-Prime Foreign National Program allows mortgagors to utilize alternative income and credit documentation. Income is typically documented by the mortgagor’s employer or accountant and credit is verified by letters from overseas credit holders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Angel Oak Asset Qualifier Program</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Asset Qualifier Program (the “<b>Angel Oak Asset Qualifier Program</b>”) is available on both the Angel Oak Platinum Program and Angel Oak Portfolio Select Program. The Angel Oak Asset Qualifier program is designed for mortgagors with prime credit and significant assets who can purchase the properties with their assets but choose to use a financing instrument for cash flow purposes. Significant assets are defined as enough assets to purchase the home plus assets to cover 60 months of debt service and four months of reserves. The mortgagor is qualified based on the mortgagor’s credit score (minimum score 700) and satisfaction of significant asset requirements and no income documentation is required. Rate/term and cash-out refinancings are also permitted under the Angel Oak Asset Qualifier Program.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Angel Oak 1099 Program</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The 1099 Program (the “<b>Angel Oak 1099 Program</b>”) is available on the Angel Oak Bank Statement Program and is designed for a Prime or Near Prime self-employed borrower who needs an alternative way to calculate their income. The typical borrower has been an employee for the same company for a minimum of two years and utilizes one or two years of 1099 statements along with personal or business bank statements to calculate income based on cash flow from those accounts. A typical Angel Oak 1099 Program mortgagor may have a credit score that is lower than that required by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines or may have been subject to a bankruptcy or foreclosure not less than 48 months prior to origination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Underwriting Guidelines</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;"><i>General</i>.

See “<i>Risk Factors—The Mortgage Loans Are Underwritten to Newly-Created Non-Agency Standards Which May Impact Their Performance</i>” in this Offering Memorandum. The Mortgage Loans are “non-conforming” in that they may not conform to the maximum mortgage loan amounts and, in some cases, to the underwriting guidelines of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, particularly with respect to the credit history of the mortgagor, waiting periods following certain bankruptcy and credit events and debt-to-income ratio requirements. These non-conforming mortgage</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">loans may not conform to or be insurable by the Federal Housing Administration and may be ineligible to be guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Underwriting Criteria by Mortgage Loan Program. <span class="p">The following chart sets forth a summary of the key underwriting criteria for each of the Angel Oak Bank Statement Program, the Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Program, the Angel Oak Platinum Program, the Angel Oak Portfolio Select Program, the Angel Oak Prime Jumbo Program and the Angel Oak Non-Prime Programs.

Consideration of the mortgagor’s length of employment, time in the same line of work, income stability and review of continuance of the mortgagor’s employment and income earnings are evaluated. To qualify, the mortgagor’s income must be from a source that is likely to generate sufficient income to repay the debt and must demonstrate consistency, such that the amounts and sources used to qualify the mortgagor are reasonably expected to remain stable and continue. Income and employment are verified via third party verification resources.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Employment Verification<span class="p">. The employment of salaried and wage earner mortgagors is verified within ten days of closing by verbal verification from the mortgagor’s employer. The employment of self-employed mortgagors is verified through verification of the existence of the mortgagor’s business within ten days of closing.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Income Verification of Salaried and Wage-Earner Mortgagors; Self-Employed Mortgagors Utilizing Bank Statement Program<span class="p">. In order to verify income, mortgagors (other than self-employed mortgagors who utilize bank statements to demonstrate income) must complete IRS Form 4506 both at application and closing. The form must request the appropriate documentation type (W-2s, full tax transcripts, etc.). For mortgagors with qualifying income from only salaried wage sources and fully documented through W-2s, the 4506 need only be executed for W-2s. For self-employed mortgagors or mortgagors with taxable income other than from salaried wage sources, the 4506 must be executed for full transcripts. Documentation received from executing the 4506 is reviewed and compared to the qualifying income to confirm consistency.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Income Verification of Self-Employed Mortgagors. <span class="p">The income of self-employed mortgagors is analyzed using either the Federal income tax returns or personal or business bank statements of the mortgagor. In the case of income tax returns, the mortgagor’s tax returns for the most recent one or two years are analyzed to determine the recurring nature of business income, measure year-to-year trends in the gross income, expenses and taxable income of the mortgagor’s business, determine the percentage of gross income attributed to expenses and taxable income and to determine any trends for the mortgagor’s business based on changes in the percentage of gross income attributed to expenses and taxable income. In lieu of providing tax returns, the Angel Oak Originators also permit a self-employed mortgagor to demonstrate income through use of the mortgagor’s bank statements. An underwriter of the Originator reviews either 12 or 24 months of personal or business bank statements in order to determine an average flow of income from the business. With respect to the self-employed mortgagors with an application date generally on or after January 19, 2021 and where the Originators used the mortgagor’s business bank account statements to verify income, or to the extent the mortgagor used its personal bank account statements without the use of a separate business bank account to operate its business, the Originators applied a fixed 50% expense ratio to calculate the personal income of the mortgagor (without requiring any additional documentation from the mortgagor). Exceptions to this included certain business industries where a fixed 70% expense ratio was applied or cases where an expense ratio less than 50% was used which required additional documentation from a third-party CPA or tax preparer (subject to a minimum floor of 30%). With respect to the self-employed mortgagors with an application date generally on or after May 8, 2020 and generally before January 19, 2021 and where the Originators used the mortgagor’s business bank account statements to verify income, or to the extent the mortgagor used its personal bank account statements without the use of a separate business bank account to operate its business, the Originators applied a fixed 30%, 50%, 70% or 90% expense ratio based primarily upon the business industry and number of full-time employees to calculate the personal income of the mortgagor (without requiring any additional documentation from the mortgagor). With respect to the self-employed mortgagors with an application date generally on or after September 20, 2019 and generally before May 8, 2020 and where the Originators used the mortgagor’s business bank account statements to verify income, or to the extent the mortgagor used its personal bank account statements without the use of a separate business bank account to operate its business, the Originators applied a fixed 50% expense ratio to calculate the personal income of the mortgagor (without requiring any additional documentation from the mortgagor). For business bank accounts, any expense ratio less than 50% (subject to a minimum floor of 35%) would require either a third party prepared business expense letter or a third party prepared profit and loss statement. For personal bank accounts, any expense ratio less than 50% would require proof of specific business parameters (separate business account or home business with no employees), a third party prepared business expense letter or a third party prepared profit and loss statement. With respect to the self-employed mortgagors with an application date prior to September 20, 2019 and where the Originators used the mortgagor’s business bank account statements to verify income, the Originators used a fixed expense ratio, a third party prepared business expense letter or a third party prepared profit and loss statement to determine such expense factor. Additionally, no expense factor was used to calculate the income when the Originators used the mortgagor’s personal bank statements prior to September 20, 2019 as well.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Of the 841 Mortgage Loans, 12 Angel Oak Mortgage Loans (underwritten to personal bank account statements), totaling $4,077,453.91 in Scheduled Principal Balance (approximately 0.98% of the aggregate Scheduled Principal Balance) as of the Cut-off Date, had an application date prior to September 20, 2019.

A mortgagor’s residual income is calculated generally based on gross monthly income minus monthly debt service. Residual income evaluation applies to owner-occupied properties only.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Assets Verification. <span class="p">The Angel Oak Originators’ Underwriting Guidelines require asset documentation of both funds to close and reserves. All funds used for closing and reserves must be sourced and seasoned no less than 30 days. Assets used for down payment and closing require evidence of the sale or redemption of the asset. In each case, the Originator requires comprehensive information regarding the assets and accounts, including ensuring the asset documentation is recent relative to the date of the loan application, and employs controls to ensure the validity of all such information, including without limitation potentially requiring additional documentation to explain or document disparities or irregularities.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Credit History<span class="p">. Among other factors, the Angel Oak Originators consider a mortgagor’s credit score in determining eligibility for one of their mortgage loan origination programs. The Angel Oak Originators obtain a credit report for each mortgagor that summarizes the mortgagor’s credit history from one or more of the three major credit repositories: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. These companies have developed scoring models to identify the comparative risk of delinquency among applicants based on characteristics within the applicant’s credit report. Credit scores are generated by models developed by a third party and are made available to lenders through Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. The models were derived by analyzing data on consumers in order to establish patterns which are believed to be indicative of the mortgagor’s probability of default. A credit score is based on a mortgagor’s historical credit data, including, among other things, payment history, delinquencies on accounts, levels of outstanding indebtedness, length of credit history, types of credit and bankruptcy experience. Credit scores range from approximately 300 to approximately 850, with higher scores indicating an individual with a more favorable credit history compared to an individual with a lower score. If only two credit scores are available, the Angel Oak Originator utilizes the lower of the two credit scores in determining whether the mortgagor satisfies the minimum requirements for the Angel Oak Bank Statement Program, the Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Program, the Angel Oak Platinum Program, the Angel Oak Portfolio Select Program, the Angel Oak Prime Jumbo Program or the Angel Oak Non-Prime General Program, as applicable. If the Angel Oak Originator is able to obtain scores from each of the three major credit repositories, the middle score is utilized. The representative credit score for the primary wage-earner will be used for the transaction when all of the following requirements are met: (i) the primary wage-earner contributes 51% of the qualifying income and (ii) the middle FICO score of primary wage-earner is used for qualifying. For the Angel Oak Bank Statement Program, the minimum credit score, absent compensating factors, is 640. For the Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Program, the minimum credit score, absent compensating factors, is 640. For the Angel Oak Platinum Program, the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">minimum credit score, absent compensating factors, is 660. For the Angel Oak Portfolio Select Program, the minimum credit score, absent compensating factors, is 600. For the Angel Oak Prime Jumbo Program, the minimum credit score, absent compensating factors, is 680. For each of the Angel Oak Non-Prime Programs, the minimum credit score, absent compensating factors, is 500. Applicants who have higher credit scores are expected, as a group, to have fewer defaults than those who have lower credit scores.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to reviewing the mortgagor’s credit history and credit score, the Angel Oak Originators’ underwriters closely review the mortgagor’s housing payment history. In general, in order to qualify for the Angel Oak Non-Prime Programs, the mortgagor should not have made any mortgage payments more than ninety days after the Due Date for the most recent twelve months. In general, in order to qualify for the Portfolio Select Program, the mortgagor may have no more than one payment that was made over 30 days after the Due Date for the most recent twelve months. All serious derogatory credit items, such as bankruptcies or foreclosures, must be satisfactorily addressed by the mortgagor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;"><i>ATR/QM Management Tool. </i>The underwriters of the Angel Oak Originators review each mortgage loan application (other than applications submitted under the Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Program) for compliance with ability-to-repay standards and eligibility for Qualified Mortgage status. The automated mortgage loan origination system utilized by the Angel Oak Originators during the mortgage loan origination, processing and approval process includes a tool (the “<b>ATR/QM Management Tool</b>”). The three primary functions of the ATR/QM Management Tool are to identify and document the factors (including mortgage loan term, lien position, note amount, points and fees, monthly payments and certain other underwriting criteria) necessary to assess ability-to-repay and Qualified Mortgage eligibility, to determine compliance with general ability-to-repay standards, eligibility for Qualified Mortgage status or exemption from CFPB requirements and safe harbor eligibility and to document debt-to-income ratio calculations consistent with Qualified Mortgage standards and the requirements of Regulation Z.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions LLC has adopted a credit risk summary and exception approval form in lieu of a ATR/QM worksheet.

The Angel Oak Originators require each mortgage loan originated by it to be secured by a property that has been appraised by a third-party licensed appraiser in accordance with both the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice of the  Appraisal Foundation and the requirements governing appraisal independence set forth in Section 129E of TILA as applicable. The appraisers perform on-site inspections of the property and report on the neighborhood and property condition in factual and specific terms. Each appraisal contains an opinion of value that represents the appraiser’s professional conclusion based on market data of sales of comparable properties, a logical analysis with adjustments for differences between the comparable sales and the subject property and the appraiser’s judgment. An appraisal may not be more than 120 days old on the day the mortgage loan is funded.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Angel Oak Originators routinely evaluate an appraiser’s work through normal underwriting review of all appraisal reports and, in addition, conduct a spot-check field review of certain appraisals as part of their quality control program. The Angel Oak Originators review appraisals to ensure that the applicable appraiser provides evidence to support the methodology used with respect to its value opinion and that the appraiser does not use unsupported assumptions or use race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin for any party in the transaction as the basis for market value.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Angel Oak Originators maintain a list of ineligible appraisers whose appraisals they will not accept. Appraisers on the ineligible list must resolve the issues that caused them to be classified as ineligible prior to being approved for use. The Angel Oak Originators utilize a third-party appraisal management company or network for certain due diligence and appraiser oversight functions. The Angel Oak Originators appraisal policies require annual audits of the appraisal management company. Depending on the results of the annual audit, the Angel Oak Originators may require and enforce a plan of corrective action, report violations of law to the appropriate authorities or terminate the relationship with the appraisal management company. The approval and oversight of all third-party appraisers and appraisal management companies is managed by executive operational leadership or a compliance manager of the applicable Angel Oak Originator.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Pre-Offering Review of the Mortgage Loans</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Sponsor, prior to including the Mortgage Loans in this securitization, engaged the Securitization Diligence Providers to conduct a review of each of the Mortgage Loans. The Sponsor also engaged other third parties to assist it with certain elements of the review of the Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Sponsor determined the nature, extent and timing of the pre-offering review and the level of assistance provided by any third party. The pre-offering review was conducted for the purpose of providing reasonable assurance that the disclosure regarding the Mortgage Pool in this Offering Memorandum is accurate in all material respects. The results of the pre-offering review were shared with the Initial Purchasers. The Initial Purchasers reviewed these findings in connection with their preparation for the offering of the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">As more fully described below, the review conducted by the Securitization Diligence Providers of the Mortgage Loans consisted of (a) a regulatory compliance review for all Mortgage Loans other than the Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loans, (b) a credit review, (c) an appraisal review, (d) a data collection and data integrity review and (e) a document review. None of the procedures conducted as part of the pre-offering review constituted, either separately or in combination, an independent underwriting of the Mortgage Loans. In addition, the procedures conducted as part of the review of the original appraisals were not re-appraisals of the mortgaged properties. To the extent that valuation tools other than a full appraisal were used as part of the appraisal review</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">process, they should not be relied upon as providing an assessment of value of the mortgaged properties comparable to that which an appraisal might provide.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The pre-offering review is not a guarantee of the future performance of any of the Mortgage Loans. There can be no assurance that the pre-offering review uncovered all relevant factors relating to the origination of the Mortgage Loans, their compliance with applicable law and regulation, and the original appraisals relating to the mortgaged properties. The Securitization Diligence Providers do not make any representation or warranty as to the value of any Mortgage Loan or loan collateral that was reviewed as part of the pre-offering review.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Securitization Diligence Providers also evaluated each Mortgage Loan according to the credit, compliance and valuation grading standards each of Fitch and KBRA. Grade “A” generally indicates compliance with all applicable guidelines, compliance laws and regulations and valuation within a 10% variance of a third- party valuation product with a compliant appraisal. Grade “B” indicates the loan meets most underwriting standards with documented, significant compensating factors, compliant with compliance laws and regulations but with minor evidentiary issues, or the loan contains open TRID exceptions that do not carry statutory damages, or the loan contains an identified exception with respect to which a remedy to cure or reasonable good faith effort to re-disclose was made, and valuation within a 10% variance of a third-party valuation product with a compliant appraisal.

Grade “C” indicates the loan does not meet every applicable guideline for the program and most of the loan characteristics are outside the guidelines; there are weak or no compensating factors for exceeding guidelines or the originator did not provide documentation to confirm it met all guidelines of the ATR Rules; or the loan’s designation under the ATR Rules cannot be confirmed; or the loan contains one or more compliance exceptions that cannot be cured or impacts the ability to foreclose and/or assignee liability, including open TRID exceptions that carry statutory damages in connection with a remedy to cure or a reasonable good faith effort to re-disclose which occurred more than 60 days from the consummation date or closing date; or the value cannot be supported within 10% of the original appraisal amount. Grade “D” generally indicates the loan file was not delivered to the applicable Securitization Diligence Provider or the file is not sufficiently complete to perform the review.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The percentages in the table below were based on the number of Mortgage Loans and the aggregate Scheduled Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date.

Securitization Diligence Providers performed a regulatory compliance review of each Mortgage Loan (other than an Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loan) to determine compliance with certain applicable federal and state disclosure requirements, appraisal and valuation requirements, points and fees limitations, counseling requirements and predatory lending laws. This review included, for example, the accuracy and completeness of information required to be included in the federal and other disclosures required by the Truth- in-Lending Act, including the TRID rule (if applicable and as further described below), and whether any of the Mortgage Loans (other than an Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loan) meet the definition of “high cost” loans under HOEPA or similar state or local law. In addition, the Securitization Diligence Providers reviewed the documentation in the loan files as provided to the Securitization Diligence Providers, and determined that such</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">information supported the Originators’ determination that the Mortgage Loan (other than an Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loan) met the appropriate requirements under Appendix Q of Regulation Z under TILA or the ATR Rules of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Securitization Diligence Providers also verified if each Mortgage Loan (other than an Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loan) was correctly characterized as a Non- Qualified Mortgage Loan or an Exempted Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Securitization Diligence Providers’ regulatory compliance review scope is based on (i) SFA Compliance Review Scope and (ii) outside counsel’s interpretation of the published regulations as of the date of review of each Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The SFA Compliance Review Scope is intended to be based on a reasoned legal analysis that expressly assumes that courts will interpret TRID in accordance with the principles of liability set forth in the letter to the MBA from Richard Cordray, the Director of the CFPB. No assurances can be provided that the courts in question will interpret TRID in accordance with the SFA Compliance Review Scope.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Securitization Diligence Providers worked with outside counsel and continue to obtain updated interpretations relative to the informal guidance provided by the CFPB which has caused alterations in the review scope and severity of TRID related exceptions, including applicable cures. This process will continue as additional information guidance or additional rulemaking occurs. While the Securitization Diligence Providers continue to make a good faith effort to identify material TRID exceptions and apply the appropriate grading, the implementation of new and evolving regulations (including TRID) carries certain interpretive risks that may impact future scopes of review and the severity of exceptions found during the Securitization Diligence Providers’ review. The Securitization Diligence Providers have worked closely with nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (“<b>NRSROs</b>” and each individually an “<b>NRSRO</b>”) and clients to disclose, as mutually agreed upon by the parties, the relevant exceptions per the Securitization Diligence Provider’s suggested review implementation as reviewed by outside counsel; however, no assurances can be provided and/or are given that the Securitization Diligence Providers have included within their review all areas that may represent risk to the Issuing Entity, or that areas of risk identified by the Securitization Diligence Providers will result in the potential level of risk indicated by a loan level grade assigned by the applicable Securitization Diligence Provider or an NRSRO grade.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Of the 841 Mortgage Loans, 557 Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 77.84% of the Mortgage Pool are subject to the TRID rule (“<b>TRID Mortgage Loans</b>”). The 275 investor purpose Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 21.70% of the Mortgage Pool are not subject to the TRID rule and the remaining nine Mortgage Loans for which the application was received before October 3, 2015, representing approximately 0.46% of the Mortgage Pool. The Securitization Diligence Providers reviewed each TRID Mortgage Loan to determine whether such Mortgage Loan contained a violation of TRID, whether such violation is able to be cured and whether such violation of TRID was cured in the manner required by Section 1026.19(f)(2)(iv) or Section 1026.19(f)(2)(v) of Regulation Z, Section 130(b) of TILA, or through good faith re-disclosure to provide the consumer with accurate information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Examples of issues relating to compliance with TRID include delivery timing, formatting and terminology issues with respect to the loan estimate disclosure form and inaccurate or missing data in the closing disclosure form. The Originators believed they made a good faith effort to address all TRID violations through the issuance of revised disclosures or other applicable remediation processes. However, certain instances of the TRID exceptions may not be curable due to timing or other factors and certain actions taken by the Originators to remediate TRID violations may not have been sufficient to cure such violation. The Sponsor independently decided to include certain Mortgage Loans subject to potential TRID violations in the Mortgage Pool with the understanding that any Angel Oak Mortgage Loans found, by judicial determination, to have violated the TRID rule may be subject to remedy by the Representation Provider in accordance with and to the extent set forth under “<i>Representations and Warranties Enforcement</i>” below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Securitization Diligence Providers found certain instances of non-compliance violations in connection with the regulatory compliance review described above. The Mortgage Loans (other than an Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loan) found by the Securitization Diligence Providers to have a non- compliance violation in connection with the regulatory compliance review were included in the Mortgage Pool because the Sponsor determined these instances of non-compliance to be immaterial and/or corrected disclosures were issued with respect to each related Mortgage Loan (other than an Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loan) prior to closing or after closing of such Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The percentages in the table below were based on the number of Mortgage Loans and the aggregate Scheduled Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date.

64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Securitization Diligence Providers conducted a review of the appraisal related to each Mortgage Loan including the age of the appraisal, verification of address, completeness of the appraisal form, analysis of demand, supply and marketing time, review of comments regarding lot size, zoning and other issues, comparable sales analysis and analysis of photos. Other than in circumstances where there were two appraisals in the Mortgage Loan file and the second appraisal value was at least 90% of the original appraisal value, the appraisal was either (i) compared to a secondary valuation product to determine whether there was support for the reasonableness of the original appraised value, including comparisons to publicly available market data, or (ii) run through Fannie Mae’s Collateral Underwriter® and Freddie Mac’s Loan Collateral Advisor®. If Fannie Mae’s Collateral Underwriter® (“<b>CU Score</b>”) risk score is in excess of 2.50 and Freddie Mac’s Loan Collateral Advisor® report does not indicate “Collateral R&amp;W Relief Eligible,” the Sponsor must validate the appraisal by obtaining either an automated valuation model value, a desk review, a broker’s price opinion or a field review. A desk review is a valuation analysis performed by a certified appraiser who reviews the original appraisal to determine if the original value is supported. That appraiser makes a separate selection of comparable sales, which</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">may be the same as those used in the original appraisal and, using a rules-based valuation model, makes an independent determination as to whether the original appraised value is supported. A field review is a valuation analysis performed by a certified appraiser who reviews the original appraisal and performs a visual inspection of the exterior areas of the property, inspects the neighborhood, performs a visual analysis of each of the comparable sales, searches public records, performs data research and analysis to determine the appropriateness and accuracy of the data in the original appraisal and presents an opinion as to whether the appraised value is supported.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In the event that the secondary valuation stated in such review was at least 90% of the original appraised value and the secondary valuation vendor met rating agency criteria, no further action was taken. If the Securitization Diligence Provider determined, based on its review of the original appraisal and the applicable secondary valuation product, that the value in the original appraisal was not supported, or if the secondary valuation product indicated a more than -10% variance from the value identified on the original appraisal or if the secondary valuation vendor did not meet rating agency criteria, then an additional secondary valuation product was ordered by the Sponsor and reviewed by the Securitization Diligence Provider.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The percentages in the table below were based on the number of Mortgage Loans and the aggregate Scheduled Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date.

the Mortgage Loans. The Securitization Diligence Providers were provided a Mortgage Loan data tape that included certain characteristics of all of the Mortgage Loans. The Securitization Diligence Providers’ review of the information in the data tape was based on a review of electronic copies of the original Mortgage Loan Documents. The Securitization Diligence Providers reviewed certain fields on the mortgage loan tape that were populated by the related Originator, and, in addition, populated other fields on the data tape.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">As a result of the data integrity review conducted by the Securitization Diligence Providers, variances in data were discovered in connection with the Mortgage Loans and corrections were made in the data tape, except with respect to values which the Sponsor considered accurate. The corrected data tape, including any other adjustments made by the Sponsor as a result of the Pre-Offering Review, was used to generate the numerical information regarding the Mortgage Loans included in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Securitization Diligence Providers noted differences in DTI ratio calculations greater than 2% for 128 Mortgage Loans based on its review. The Sponsor did not update the DTI values for these Mortgage Loans. The non-zero weighted average DTI ratio of the Mortgage Pool (based on aggregate Scheduled Principal Balance as of the Cut-off Date) would change from approximately 30.72% to approximately 30.50% if the Securitization Diligence Providers’ values were used on such 128 Mortgage Loans. The Sponsor decided not to update the data tape for the related DTI variances because the DTI ratio calculations fell within the Originators’ Underwriting Guidelines. In addition, there were a lesser number of discrepancies noted by the Securitization Diligence Providers for certain data fields. However, the Sponsor elected to use its own values to populate such fields in the Mortgage Loan Schedule based on its findings. An additional component of the pre-offering review consisted of recalculations by a third party engaged by the Sponsor of the numerical disclosures selected by the Sponsor and appearing in this Offering Memorandum. These disclosures include the percentages of Mortgage Loans with certain characteristics, which are included under the caption “<i>The Mortgage Loans</i>,” and the numerical information contained in “<i>Annex A – Certain Characteristics of the Mortgage Loans</i>” (together, the “<b>Mortgage Pool Disclosures</b>”). The recalculations were performed using the data tape, including any adjustments made by the Sponsor, and the results of those recalculations were compared to, or incorporated in (other than above), the corresponding Mortgage Pool Disclosures.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document Review</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">For each Mortgage Loan, the Securitization Diligence Providers reviewed the loan file and verified the presence of required documents (including the Note, Mortgage, Title, HUD, Initial TIL, Final TIL, Loan Estimate, Closing Disclosure, Appraisal, Application, Credit Report, and applicable disclosures).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Securitization Diligence Providers found that no material documents were missing on the Mortgage Loans other than those that may have been noted as an exception on Annex B.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Review of Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loans</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to the credit, compliance, valuation, and data integrity scopes described herein, the Securitization Diligence Providers performed an incremental review of certain underwriting requirements for the Angel Oak Investor Cash Flow Mortgage Loans.

Such reviews should not be construed as or relied upon as providing an assessment of value of the Mortgaged Properties comparable to that which an appraisal might provide.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">The property valuation review conducted by the Securitization Diligence Providers was not an assessment of the current value of any of the Mortgaged Properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">Differences may exist among and between estimated valuations due to the subjective nature of estimated valuations and appraisals, particularly between different appraisers estimating valuations or performing appraisals at different points in time, as well as among appraisers and other persons reviewing the appraisals or other valuations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">Estimating or appraising the value of, and performing other analyses of, high-value properties (such as some of the Mortgaged Properties) can involve challenges that may not generally be present with respect to properties whose values fall within the average price range of their respective markets. There may be fewer substitute properties available (from which to derive comparative values) in the high-value residential property market, unique buyer attitudes and preferences, and more difficult to quantify “appeal” issues, any of which can make valuations in the high-value home segment less precise than for more average-priced housing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">Estimates of value for high-value properties are imprecise. The unique nature of some of these properties, the use in some cases of highly customized and top-quality materials, overall interior design/appeal issues, and in many cases limited notations in the original appraisal report regarding key elements that drove the original property valuation, pose challenges for a subsequent reviewer. Also, the Securitization Diligence Providers do not have, among other things, independent access to an interior inspection of the property and therefore are not able to independently analyze the interior appointments and amenities associated with the valuation of these types of properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">Appraisals and other valuations and reviews of those appraisals and valuations represent the analysis and opinion of the person performing the appraisal, valuation or review at the time it is prepared, and are not guarantees of, and may not be indicative of, the present or future value of the Mortgaged Property.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Investors are advised that the aforementioned review procedures carried out by the Securitization Diligence Providers were performed for the benefit of the Sponsor and its affiliates.

Persons acquiring beneficial ownership interests in the Book-Entry Certificates (“<b>Certificate Owners</b>”) will hold such Certificates through The Depository Trust Company (“<b>DTC</b>”) (in the United States) or Clearstream Banking (“<b>Clearstream</b>”) or the Euroclear System (“<b>Euroclear</b>”) (in Europe) if they are  participants of such systems (the “<b>Participants</b>”), or indirectly through  organizations which are participants in such systems (the “<b>Indirect Participants</b>”). Each class of Book-Entry Certificates will be issued in one or more certificates which equal the aggregate Certificate Principal Balance of such Certificates and will initially be registered in the name of Cede &amp; Co., the nominee of DTC. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold omnibus positions on behalf of their Participants through customers’ securities accounts in Clearstream’s and Euroclear’s names on the books of their respective depositaries which in turn will hold such positions in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Citibank, N.A. will act as depositary for Clearstream and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association will act as depositary for Euroclear (in such capacities, individually the “<b>Relevant Depositary</b>” and collectively the “<b>European Depositaries</b>”). Investors may hold such beneficial interests in the Book-Entry Certificates in minimum denominations of $50,000 and integral multiples of $1 in excess thereof. Except as described below, no person acquiring a Book-Entry Certificate (each, a “<b>beneficial owner</b>”) will be entitled to receive a physical security representing such Certificate (a “<b>Definitive Certificate</b>”).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Unless and until Definitive Certificates are issued, it is anticipated that the only “<b>Certificateholder</b>” of the Book Entry Certificates will be Cede &amp; Co., as nominee of DTC.

While the Book-Entry Certificates are outstanding (except under the circumstances described below), under the rules, regulations and procedures creating and affecting DTC and its operations (the “<b>Rules</b>”), DTC is required to make book-entry transfers among Participants on whose behalf it acts with respect to the Book-Entry Certificates and is required to receive and transmit distributions of principal of, and interest on, the Book-Entry Certificates. Participants and Indirect Participants with whom Certificate Owners have accounts with respect to Book-Entry Certificates are similarly required to make book-entry transfers and receive and transmit such distributions on behalf of their respective Certificate Owners. Accordingly, although Certificate Owners will not possess certificates representing their respective interests in the Book-Entry Certificates, the Rules provide a mechanism by which Certificate Owners will receive distributions and will be able to transfer their interest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certificateholders will not receive or be entitled to receive certificates representing their respective interests in the Book-Entry Certificates, except under the limited circumstances described below. Unless and until Definitive Certificates are issued, Certificateholders who are not Participants may transfer ownership of Book- Entry Certificates only through Participants and Indirect Participants by instructing such Participants and Indirect Participants to transfer Book-Entry Certificates, by book-entry transfer, through DTC for the account of the purchasers of such Book-Entry Certificates, which account is maintained with their respective Participants. Under the Rules and in accordance with DTC’s normal procedures, transfers of ownership of Book-Entry Certificates will be executed through DTC and the accounts of the respective Participants at DTC will be debited and credited. Similarly, the Participants and Indirect Participants will make debits or credits, as the case may be, on their records on behalf of the selling and purchasing Certificateholders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Because of time zone differences, credits of securities received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a Participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or any transactions in such securities settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream Participants on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of sales of securities by or through a Clearstream Participant or Euroclear Participant to a DTC Participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or Euroclear cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Transfers between Participants will occur in accordance with DTC Rules.

The relevant European international clearing system will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the Relevant Depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving securities in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream Participants and Euroclear Participants may not deliver instructions directly to the European Depositaries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">DTC, which is a New York-chartered limited purpose trust company, performs services for its Participants, some of which (and/or their representatives) own DTC. In accordance with its normal procedures, DTC is expected to record the positions held by each DTC Participant in the Book-Entry Certificates, whether held for its own account or as a nominee for another person. In general, beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Certificates will be subject to the Rules, as in effect from time to time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Clearstream, a Luxembourg limited liability company, was formed in January 2000 through the merger of Cedel International and Deutsche Boerse Clearing.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Clearstream is registered as a bank in Luxembourg, and as such is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Monetary Authority, which supervises Luxembourg banks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Clearstream holds securities for its customers (“<b>Clearstream Participants</b>”) and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions by electronic book-entry transfers between their accounts. Clearstream provides various services, including safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream also deals with domestic securities markets in several countries through established depository and custodial relationships. Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. as the Euroclear Operator in Brussels to facilitate settlement of trades between systems. Clearstream currently accepts over 200,000 securities issues on its books.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Clearstream’s customers are world-wide financial institutions including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations. Clearstream’s United States customers are limited to securities brokers and dealers and banks. Currently, Clearstream has approximately 2,500 customers located in over 110 countries, including all major European countries, Canada, and the United States. Indirect access to Clearstream is available to other institutions which clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with an account holder of Clearstream.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Euroclear was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants (“<b>Euroclear Participants</b>”) and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Transactions may be settled in a variety of currencies, including United States dollars. Euroclear provides various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries generally similar to the arrangements for cross-market transfers with DTC described above. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (the “<b>Euroclear Operator</b>”). All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator. Euroclear plc establishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of Euroclear Participants. Euroclear Participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant, either directly or indirectly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions governing use of Euroclear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System and applicable Belgian law (collectively, the “<b>Terms and Conditions</b>”). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific securities to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear Participants, and has no record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear Participants.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Distributions on the Book-Entry Certificates will be made on each Distribution Date by the Paying Agent to Cede &amp; Co., as nominee of DTC. DTC will be responsible for crediting the amount of such distributions to the accounts of the applicable DTC Participants in accordance with DTC’s normal procedures. Each DTC Participant will be responsible for disbursing such distributions to the Beneficial Owners of the Book-Entry Certificates that it represents and to each Financial Intermediary for which it acts as agent. Each such Financial Intermediary will be responsible for disbursing funds to the Beneficial Owners of the Book-Entry Certificates that it represents.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Under a book-entry format, Beneficial Owners of the Book-Entry Certificates may experience some delay in their receipt of distributions, since such distributions will be forwarded by the Paying Agent to Cede &amp; Co. Distributions with respect to Certificates held through Clearstream or Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Clearstream Participants or Euroclear Participants in accordance with the relevant system’s rules and procedures, to the extent received by the Relevant Depositary. Such distributions will be subject to tax reporting in accordance with relevant United States tax laws and regulations. See “<i>Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Reporting and Other Administrative Matters</i>” and “—<i>Backup Withholding With Respect to Offered Certificates</i>” in this Offering Memorandum. Because DTC can only act on behalf of DTC Participants, the ability of a beneficial owner to pledge Book-Entry Certificates to persons or entities that do not participate in the book-entry system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such Book-Entry Certificates, may be limited due to the lack of physical securities for such Book-Entry Certificates. In addition, issuance of the Book-Entry</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Certificates in book-entry form may reduce the liquidity of such Certificates in the secondary market since certain potential investors may be unwilling to purchase Certificates for which they cannot obtain physical securities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Monthly and annual reports on the Certificates will be provided to Cede &amp; Co., as nominee of DTC, and may be made available by Cede &amp; Co. to beneficial owners upon request, in accordance with the rules, regulations and procedures creating and affecting the DTC Participants to whose DTC accounts the Book-Entry Certificates of such beneficial owners are credited.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">DTC has advised the Paying Agent that, unless and until Definitive Certificates are issued, DTC will take any action the holders of the Book-Entry Certificates are permitted to take under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement only at the direction of one or more DTC Participants to whose DTC accounts the Book-Entry Certificates are credited, to the extent that such actions are taken on behalf of Financial Intermediaries whose holdings include such Book-Entry Certificates. Clearstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case may be, will take any other action permitted to be taken by a Certificateholder under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement on behalf of a Clearstream Participant or Euroclear Participant only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures and subject to the ability of the Relevant Depositary to effect such actions on its behalf through DTC. DTC may take actions, at the direction of the related Participants, with respect to some Book-Entry Certificates which conflict with actions taken with respect to other Book-Entry Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Definitive Certificates will be issued to beneficial owners of the Book-Entry Certificates, or their nominees, rather than to DTC, only if DTC advises the Paying Agent in writing that DTC is no longer willing, qualified or able to discharge properly its responsibilities as nominee and depository with respect to the Book- Entry Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Upon the occurrence of the event described in the immediately preceding paragraph, the Paying Agent will be required to notify all beneficial owners of the occurrence of such event and the availability through DTC of Definitive Certificates. Upon surrender by DTC of the global note or certificates representing the Book-Entry Certificates and instructions for re-registration, the Issuing Entity will issue Definitive Certificates, and thereafter the Issuing Entity, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Paying Agent will recognize the holders of such Definitive Certificates as Certificateholders under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Although DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of Book-Entry Certificates among participants of DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and such procedures may be discontinued at any time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">None of the Sponsor, the Seller, the Depositor, the Issuing Entity, the Servicing Administrator, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Custodian, the Master Servicer or the Initial Purchasers will have any responsibility for any aspect of the records relating to or distributions made on account of beneficial ownership interests of the Book-Entry Certificates held by Cede &amp; Co., as nominee for DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Documentation Requirements</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A beneficial owner of Book-Entry Certificates that is not a U.S. Tax Person (a “<b>Non-U.S. Tax Person</b>”) holding a Book-Entry Certificate through Clearstream, Euroclear or DTC may be subject to U.S. withholding tax unless it provides certain documentation to the Issuing Entity of the Book-Entry Certificates, the clearing system, a paying agent or any other entity required to withhold tax (any of the foregoing, a “<b>U.S. Withholding Agent</b>”) establishing an exemption from withholding.

As a result, Certificates may be resold or transferred only to (i) “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in compliance therewith or (ii) non-“U.S. Persons” (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) and in compliance therewith.

A transferee of an interest in a book-entry certificate, by acceptance of its interest therein, will be deemed to have made all applicable representations set forth in an investment letter and set forth herein under “Notice to Investors.” Each transferee will agree to indemnify the Issuing Entity, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Servicing Administrator and the Depositor against any liability that may result from a transfer by such Certificateholder that is not made in accordance with such laws or the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Certificate Registrar will not have the ability to monitor transfers of the Certificates while they are in book-entry form and will have no liability for transfers of the Certificates in violation of any of the transfer restrictions described in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will provide that any attempted or purported transfer in violation of these transfer restrictions will be null and void and will vest no rights in any purported transferee.

The amount of the applicable Prepayment Premium, to the extent permitted under applicable federal, state or local law, is as provided in the related Mortgage Note. Generally, this amount is equal to the product of six months of interest on 80% of the Unpaid Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan if the prepayment during the term exceeds 20% of the original Unpaid Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan.

To the extent the Servicer fails to make a required P&amp;I Advance, the Master Servicer will be obligated to make such advance or terminate the Servicer and appoint a successor that will make such P&amp;I Advance. A P&amp;I Advance is “nonrecoverable” (and, consequently, the related Mortgage Loan is a Stop Advance Mortgage Loan) if in the judgment of the Servicer or, in certain instances, the Master Servicer, such P&amp;I Advance would not ultimately be recoverable from the collections on or proceeds of the related Mortgage Loan. P&amp;I Advances are intended to maintain a regular cashflow to the holders of the Certificates, rather than to guarantee or insure against losses. P&amp;I Advances are reimbursable to the Servicer or the Master Servicer, as applicable, from collections in respect of the related Mortgage Loan, including late collections, Liquidation Proceeds, condemnation proceeds, insurance proceeds and such other amounts as may be collected from the related mortgagor or otherwise relating to the Mortgage Loan. If the Servicer or the Master Servicer determines that a P&amp;I Advance has become a nonrecoverable advance, the Servicer or the Master Servicer, as applicable, will be entitled to reimbursement for that advance from collections in respect of all of the Mortgage Loans prior to any distributions to Certificateholders. In addition, if the Servicer determines in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement that a Servicing Advance becomes non- recoverable, or (i) with respect to a P&amp;I Advance or Servicing Advance for a Mortgage Loan that is subject to a modification or (ii) with respect to a P&amp;I Advance for a Mortgage Loan that is subject to a deferral, the Servicer will be entitled to reimbursement for such advance upon determination of non-recoverability or at the time of deferral or modification from collections in respect of all the Mortgage Loans prior to any distributions to the Certificateholders. The Servicer will determine that a proposed advance is non-recoverable (and consequently, that the related Mortgage Loan is a Stop Advance Mortgage Loan) when, in its good faith judgment, it believes the proposed advance would not ultimately be recoverable from the related mortgagor, related Liquidation Proceeds or other recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loan.

The Servicer, however, will not be required to make any Servicing Advance which the Servicer determines would be a nonrecoverable Servicing Advance. A Servicing Advance is “nonrecoverable” if in the judgment of the Servicer, such Servicing Advance would not ultimately be recoverable from the collections on or proceeds of the related Mortgage Loan. Servicing Advances are reimbursable to the Servicer from collections in respect of the related Mortgage Loan, including late collections, Liquidation Proceeds, condemnation proceeds, insurance proceeds and such other amounts as may be collected from the related mortgagor or otherwise related to the Mortgage Loan.

The Servicing Administrator will confirm with the Servicer that such recommended strategy is consistent with accepted servicing practices and applicable law and procedures related to the performance of such loan modifications or such other loss mitigation resolutions. The Servicer will comply with the Servicing Administrator’s direction with respect to loan modification and other loss mitigation resolutions. The time frame for most loans to be eligible for foreclosure referral is expected to be around 120 days past due.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">As of November 30, 2021, none of the mortgagors are on an active forbearance plan from the Servicer due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, 34 of the mortgagors, representing approximately 4.02% of the Mortgage Pool, had their initial two or more month forbearance term expire, are no longer on an active forbearance plan and are current as of the Cut-off Date. Twelve Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 1.35% of the Mortgage Pool, have $209,839.91 of Pre-Closing Deferred Amounts. At the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, mortgagors who requested relief on their Mortgage Loans due to the COVID-19 outbreak were automatically granted an initial three month forbearance period by the Servicer. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, however, the Servicer and the Servicing Administrator have developed a hardship affidavit for each mortgagor to complete prior to granting three months of forbearance. In either case, the Servicer may extend the forbearance period on a case-by-case basis if the mortgagor cannot repay the forborne payments immediately and a subsequent loss mitigation option is not finalized (or the hardship affidavit has not been submitted by the borrower/reviewed</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">by the Servicer). At the end of the forbearance period, the Servicer will require each mortgagor who cannot repay the forborne payments in full (to the extent not prohibited by law) to provide a package of employment, financial and credit information so that the Servicer and the Servicing Administrator may evaluate the optimal loss mitigation option, based on a waterfall of loss mitigation options, jointly developed by the Servicer and the Servicing Administrator. Such options include, but are not limited to, various repayment plans (which may include partial use of unemployment benefits), deferral plans, capitalization and extension plans, rate and/or term modifications, short sales, principal reduction modifications and deed-in-lieu transactions for mortgagors impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. The Servicer will inform the Servicing Administrator of the loss mitigation option selected and will provide all supporting documentation to the Servicing Administrator for review and approval. The Servicer and the Servicing Administrator will continue to evaluate and implement a variety of loss mitigation techniques with respect to delinquent and defaulted loans over the course of the transaction, including in response to any governmental programs designed to keep mortgagors in their homes, in an effort to maximize distributions to the Certificateholders while taking into account the best interests of the mortgagors. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Servicer shall not commence any waiver, variance or modification that would result in a principal reduction, short sale, short refinance or deed-in-lieu transaction with respect to any Mortgage Loan that is 60 or more days delinquent under the MBA Method as of the Closing Date until at least 90 days after the Closing Date and only if such Mortgage Loan is more delinquent at the time of such action than it was on the Closing Date.

However, Principal Prepayments will only be passed through to the Certificateholders once a month on the Distribution Date that follows the applicable Prepayment Period in which the prepayment was received by the Servicer. Prepayment Interest Shortfalls, to the extent not covered by Compensating Interest Payments or Prepayment Interest Excess for such Distribution Date, will result in a shortfall in interest collections on the Mortgage Loans for such Distribution Date. With respect to each Distribution Date, payment will be made from the Excess Servicing Strip in an amount not to exceed the Compensating Interest Payment for such Distribution Date. Any Net Prepayment Interest Excess will be payable to the Class A-IO-S Certificates to the extent described herein.

With respect to each Distribution Date, payment will be made from the Excess Servicing Strip in an amount not to exceed the Compensating Interest Payment for such Distribution Date. A voluntary Principal Prepayment in full by a mortgagor with respect to a Mortgage Loan that is received by the Servicer in the second half of the Prepayment Period will result in Prepayment Interest Excess. Any Net Prepayment Interest Excess will be payable to the Class A-IO-S Certificates to the extent described herein.

The Class B-X Certificates will not receive any Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution upon an Optional Redemption. After exercising its call option, the Depositor may, at its option, direct the Trustee to effect termination of the Issuing Entity and redemption of the Certificates, provided, however, such redemption will be permitted only pursuant to a “qualified liquidation” as defined under Section 860F of the Code, provided, further, no termination of the Issuing Entity will be permitted until all fees, expenses and indemnification amounts owing to the transaction parties have been paid in full without regard, in the case of the Servicing Administrator, the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Custodian, to the Annual Cap.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">SERVICING OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Set forth below are summaries of the specific terms and provisions pursuant to which the Mortgage Loans will be serviced by the Servicer and certain other duties will be performed by the Servicing Administrator and the Master Servicer.

Any Net Interest Excess will be paid up to an amount equal to the product of (a) 1/12th of 0.0300%, and (b) the aggregate Scheduled Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the first day of the related Due Period to the Servicing Administrator in respect of the Servicing Administration Fee.

To the extent the Servicing Fee on the Mortgage Loans exceeds the Gross Administration Fee with respect to any Distribution Date, the Servicer will have the right to retain such Servicing Fees (to the extent unpaid) from the Gross Administration Fee that would otherwise be distributed to the holders of the Class A-IO-S Certificates on subsequent Distribution Dates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Master Servicer will be entitled to receive the Master Servicing Fee as compensation for its activities under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

In addition, to the extent the Master Servicer has made any P&amp;I Advances, the Master Servicer will be entitled to reimbursement for such amounts from Liquidation Proceeds  on  the related Mortgaged Properties  (and, if insufficient, from collections on all the Mortgage Loans) prior to distributions on the Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Collection and Other Servicing Procedures</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Servicer will be responsible for making reasonable efforts to collect all payments called for under the Mortgage Loans, consistent with the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and will follow such collection procedures as it follows with respect to loans held for its own account that are comparable to the Mortgage Loans. Consistent with the above, the Servicer, with the consent of the Servicing Administrator may (i) waive any late payment charge or, if applicable, any penalty interest or (ii) extend the due dates for the monthly payments only under GSE guidance, following a natural disaster. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the consent of the Servicing Administrator is required in connection with any modification, waiver or amendment of a Mortgage Loan that (1) extends the scheduled final maturity date of the Mortgage Loan, (2) waives, reduces or postpones any scheduled repayment, (3) reduces the Mortgage Interest Rate (except for a reduction of interest payments resulting from the application of the Relief Act or any similar state statutes) or (4) extends the time for payment of any interest or fees.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Servicer will be required to accurately and fully report its mortgagor payment histories to three national credit repositories in a timely manner with respect to each Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If a Mortgaged Property has been or is about to be conveyed by the mortgagor, the Servicer will be obligated to accelerate the maturity of the Mortgage Loan, unless the Servicer, in its sole business judgment, believes it is unable to enforce that Mortgage Loan’s “due-on-sale” clause under applicable law or that such enforcement is not in the best interest of the Issuing Entity. If it reasonably believes it may be restricted for any reason from enforcing such a “due-on-sale” clause or that such enforcement is not in the best interest of the Issuing Entity,  the  Servicer,  with the  consent of  the Servicing  Administrator,  may enter into an  assumption  and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">modification agreement with the person to whom the Mortgaged Property has been or is about to be conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under the Mortgage Note.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Any fee collected by the Servicer for entering into an assumption agreement will be retained by the Servicer as additional servicing compensation.

For a description of circumstances in which a servicer of mortgage loans may be unable to enforce “due-on-sale” clauses, see “<i>Material Legal Aspects of the Loans—Due-on-Sale Clauses</i>” in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">On the Servicer Remittance Date, the Servicer will remit to the Master Servicer, or otherwise cause to be deposited in the Master Servicer Collection Account, all principal and interest collected on the Mortgage Loans (subject to permitted withdrawals).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Servicing of Defaulted Mortgage Loans</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Pooling and Servicing Agreement requires the Servicer, with the consent of the Servicing Administrator as described below, to take such action with respect to defaulted Mortgage Loans and REO properties as the Servicer deems to be in the best interest of the Certificateholders. While this may require the Servicer to foreclose upon or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of Mortgaged Properties securing defaulted Mortgage Loans as to which no satisfactory collection arrangements can be made, the Servicer is also authorized, subject to the standards for servicing defaulted Mortgage Loans set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and, to the extent required by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the consent of the Servicing Administrator, to enter into repayment plans or forbearance plans with mortgagors. In addition, the Servicer may modify the payment terms of Mortgage Loans that are in default, as to which the Servicer has determined default is reasonably foreseeable or imminent, as applicable, or in compliance with any extension of the COVID-19 Revenue Procedure or any substantially similar future guidance from the IRS or Treasury Department or U.S. federal legislation or regulation by reducing the Mortgage Interest Rate, forgiving payments of interest, principal or prepayment charges, extending the final maturity date (provided, that, no extension beyond the Stated Final Maturity Date for the Certificates will be permitted under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement), capitalizing or deferring delinquent interest and other amounts owed under the Mortgage Loans, deferring principal payments, with or without interest, or any combination of these or other modifications that comply with accepted servicing practices, <i>provided </i>that the consent of the Servicing Administrator is required in connection with (a) any modifications, waivers and amendments of a Mortgage Loan that (1) extends the scheduled final maturity date of the Mortgage Loan, (2) waives, reduces or postpones any scheduled repayment, (3) reduces the Mortgage Interest Rate, (4) extends the time for payment of any interest or fees or (5) reduces the Unpaid Principal Balance and (b) acceptance of short payoffs, provided further, no waiver, variance or modification that would result in a principal reduction, short sale, short refinance or deed-in-lieu transaction may be taken with respect to any Mortgage Loan that is 60 or more days delinquent under the MBA Method as of the Closing Date until at least 90 days after the Closing Date and only if such Mortgage Loan is more delinquent at the time of such action than it was on the Closing Date. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will not require the Servicer to record the terms of any modification agreement, unless required by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer will not make or permit any modification, waiver, or amendment of any Mortgage Loan which would cause any Adverse REMIC Event.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In the case of foreclosure or of damage to a Mortgaged Property or an REO property, unless otherwise required by any federal, state or local law or regulation, the Servicer will not be required to make Servicing Advances in order to foreclose or restore any damaged property, unless the Servicer determines (i) that such foreclosure and/or restoration will increase the proceeds of liquidation of the Mortgage Loan or REO property after reimbursement of expenses and (ii) that such expenses will be recoverable through Liquidation Proceeds or any applicable insurance policy in respect of such Mortgage Loan. In the event that the Servicer has advanced its own funds for foreclosure or to restore damaged property, the Servicer will be entitled to recover such expenses as Servicing Advances to the extent permitted by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">After the Servicer has made a final recovery determination with respect to a Mortgage Loan, and, if applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable state law relating to the collection of a deficiency balance from the related mortgagor, the Servicer is authorized, on behalf of the Issuing Entity, to collect from the related mortgagor any deficiency balance remaining unpaid on the applicable Mortgage Loan, or, if the related Mortgaged Property has not been foreclosed upon and sold (and therefore there is no deficiency), any outstanding balance. The Servicer may, with the consent of the Servicing Administrator, choose to collect the deficiency balance or remaining balance either directly, or indirectly by engaging an unaffiliated or affiliated third party to collect (or</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">by conveying to an unaffiliated or affiliated third party the right to collect) such balance from the applicable mortgagor. Any proceeds received by the Servicer from such direct or indirect collection efforts, net of any expenses incurred in such collection efforts, will constitute property of the Issuing Entity (for distribution to the Certificateholders) and will be deposited into the Collection Account.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hazard and Flood Insurance</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">With respect to each Mortgaged Property, the Servicer is required to cause to be maintained a hazard insurance policy for the Mortgage Loans with coverage which contains a standard mortgagee’s clause in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the full insurable value of such Mortgaged Property or (ii) the Unpaid Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loan, in each case in an amount not less than such amount as is necessary to prevent the mortgagor from becoming a coinsurer. All amounts collected by the Servicer under any hazard policy, except for amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or released to the mortgagor in accordance with the Servicer’s servicing procedures, to the extent they constitute Net Liquidation Proceeds, will ultimately be deposited in the Collection Account.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The ability of the Servicer to assure that hazard insurance proceeds are appropriately applied may be dependent on its being named as an additional insured under any hazard insurance policy, or upon the extent to which information in this regard is furnished to the Servicer by a mortgagor. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides that the Servicer may satisfy its obligation to cause hazard policies to be maintained by maintaining a blanket policy insuring against losses on the Mortgage Loans. Such blanket policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case, in the event that the Servicer did not maintain on the related Mortgaged Property a policy complying with the immediately preceding paragraph, and a loss which would have been covered by such policy has occurred, the Servicer will deposit in the Collection Account at the time of such loss the amount not otherwise payable under the blanket policy because of such deductible clause, such amount to be deposited from the Servicer’s funds, as applicable, without reimbursement therefore.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In general, the standard form of fire and extended coverage policy covers physical damage to or destruction of the improvements on the property by fire, lightning, explosion, smoke, windstorm and hail, and riot, strike and civil commotion, subject to the conditions and exclusions specified in each policy. Although the policies relating to the Mortgage Loans will be underwritten by different insurers under different state laws in accordance with different applicable state forms and therefore will not contain identical terms and conditions, the terms of the policies are dictated by respective state laws, and most such policies typically do not cover any physical damage resulting from the following: war, revolution, governmental actions, floods and other weather- related causes, earth movement, including earthquakes, landslides and mudflows, nuclear reactions, wet or dry rot, vermin, rodents, insects or domestic animals, theft and, in certain cases, vandalism.

After such notice is received, the Paying Agent will make such notice available to the Certificateholders and the Certificateholders may direct the Trustee to take such actions if the same conditions described in clauses (i) and</p><ol id="l41"><li><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of the following paragraph are satisfied, in which event the provisions below regarding the recovery and reimbursement of fees will apply.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If, as a result of a review to determine whether there are bona fide legal grounds for contesting a governmental entity’s proposed exercise of its power of eminent domain to acquire a Mortgage Loan or whether the offered payment constitutes the fair market value of a Mortgage Loan, the Controlling Representative concludes that it will not contest the proposed acquisition, then the Controlling Representative will notify the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Servicing Administrator in writing of this decision and provide details of the review, and the Paying Agent will make such notice available to the Certificateholders. After such notification has been delivered, notwithstanding such a determination by the Controlling Representative, the Certificateholders may direct the Trustee to contest an acquisition of a Mortgage Loan through exercise of the power of eminent domain or the amount of the offered payment for such Mortgage Loan, if, within 30 days of notification of the Certificateholders, (i) the Trustee receives written direction to do so by the holders of more than 50% of the Certificates by outstanding Certificate Principal Balance and (ii) the holders directing the Trustee to take such action agree to provide in advance to the Trustee funds to pay for any fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Trustee and to provide any indemnification reasonably requested by the Trustee. In connection with any such action, the Trustee will pursue reimbursement for its fees, costs and expenses from the governmental entity, if directed to do so by the Certificateholders that provided such funds to the Trustee as described above. If the Trustee recovers any such fees, costs and expenses, it will be obligated to pay or cause such amounts to be paid by the Paying Agent to such Certificateholders unless the Certificateholders directing the Trustee have not satisfied their obligations to pay the fees, costs, expenses and indemnities of the Trustee in taking such action, in which case such amounts will be retained by the Trustee for such purposes.

As part of the initial certification, the Custodian will create a list of exceptions related to the Mortgage Loan file which will include any documents required to be delivered to the Custodian that are missing. With respect to any missing documentation, other than intervening assignments which have been submitted for recording, a mortgage being out for recording, or an original title policy where a copy of the original title policy is contained in the Mortgage Loan file, the Custodian will notify the Depositor, the Trustee and the Representation Provider of the missing documentation on the Closing Date. Otherwise, the Custodian will not monitor the Mortgage Loan file until one year after the Closing Date, when a final certification will be provided. If there are any documents which are still missing from the Mortgage Loan file, the Custodian will notify the Depositor, the Trustee, the Representation Provider and the Representation and Warranty Reviewer of the missing documentation. A determination will be made by the Representation and Warranty Reviewer as to whether the failure to provide any missing documentation constitutes a Material Breach.

Notwithstanding the above, the Representation Provider is not required to repurchase a Mortgage Loan solely because an original document submitted for recording has not been delivered to the Custodian due to a delay caused by the recording office. The determination of a Material Breach for missing loan documentation will not require the Mortgage Loan to have first become delinquent.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Limitation on Suits</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Certificateholder will have any right under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to institute any proceeding with respect to such agreement unless (i) the Controlling Representative has made written request to the Trustee to institute any such proceedings, (ii) the Trustee for 30 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, has failed to institute any such proceeding and (iii) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 30-day period by the Controlling Representative.

A “<b>Majority-Owned Affiliate</b>”) of a securitizer is an entity that, directly or indirectly, majority controls, is majority controlled by or is under common majority control with, the securitizer and “majority control” means ownership of more than 50 percent of the equity of an entity, or ownership of any other controlling financial interest in the entity, as determined under generally accepted accounting principles.

Prepayments (which, as used in this Offering Memorandum, include all unscheduled payments of principal, including payments as the result of liquidations, sales and repurchases) of the Mortgage Loans will result in distributions to Certificateholders then entitled to distributions in respect of principal of amounts which would otherwise be paid over the remaining terms of such Mortgage Loans. Since the rate of prepayment on the Mortgage Loans will depend on future events and a variety of factors (as described more fully below), no assurance can be given as to such rate or the rate of principal distributions or yield on, or Weighted Average Life of, an Offered Certificate or the aggregate amount of distributions on the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The rate of principal payments on the Mortgage Loans will be affected by the amortization of the Mortgage Loans, the rate and timing of Principal Prepayments (including Partial Prepayments and those resulting from refinancing) thereon by mortgagors, the rate, timing and allocation of payaheads, liquidations of defaulted Mortgage Loans, the timing of mortgagors’ monthly payments and modifications of Mortgage Loans. If prevailing rates for similar mortgage loans fall below the Mortgage Interest Rates on the Mortgage Loans, the rate of prepayment would generally be expected to increase. Conversely, if interest rates on similar mortgage loans rise above the Mortgage Interest Rates on the Mortgage Loans, the rate of prepayment would generally be expected to decrease. Repurchases by the Representation Provider of Mortgage Loans as a result of certain defective or missing documentation or Material Breaches of representations and warranties or Optional Purchases effected by the Seller will have the effect of a prepayment in full of such Mortgage Loans, and the exercise of the Optional Termination or Optional Redemption will have the effect of a prepayment in full of all of the Mortgage Loans. See “<i>Mortgage Loan Representations and Warranties—Repurchase Requests and Arbitration</i>” and “<i>Description of the Certificates—Optional Termination” </i>and <i>“Description of the Certificates—Optional Redemption” </i>in this Offering Memorandum<i>.</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If a holder of an Offered Certificate calculates its anticipated yield based on an assumed rate of default and amount of Realized Losses that is lower than the default rate and amount of losses, its actual yield to maturity will be lower than that so calculated. The timing of Realized Losses will also affect a holder of an Offered Certificate’s actual yield to maturity, even if the average rate of defaults and severity of losses are consistent with such holder’s expectations. In general, the earlier a loss occurs, the greater the effect on an investor’s yield to maturity. There can be no assurance as to the delinquency, foreclosure or loss experience with respect to the Mortgage Loans or the loss severity thereon.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Other factors affecting prepayment of mortgage loans include changes in mortgagors’ housing needs, job transfers, unemployment or substantial fluctuations in income, significant declines in real estate values and adverse economic conditions either generally or in particular geographic areas, mortgagors’ equity in mortgaged properties and servicing decisions, such as, without limitation, the decision as to whether to foreclose on a mortgage loan or to modify the terms of the related Mortgage Note and decisions as to the timing of any foreclosure. The effects of each of these factors may have been heightened by the COVID-19 outbreak. See “<i>Risk Factors— The COVID-19 Outbreak May Adversely Affect the Performance, Liquidity and Market Value of the Offered Certificates</i>” in this Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, certain characteristics of mortgage loans are thought by some in the mortgage industry to be more likely to affect prepayments. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, Unpaid Principal Balance, loan-to-value ratio, credit quality of mortgagors and a current mortgage rate higher than prevailing interest rates. No representation is made as to the rate of prepayment on the Mortgage Loans having any particular characteristic. Since the Mortgage Loans contain due-on-sale clauses, acceleration of mortgage payments as a result of any such sale will affect the level of prepayments on the Mortgage Loans. See “<i>Certain Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loans—</i>“<i>Due on Sale</i>” <i>Clauses</i>” in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the Servicer, subject to consent of the Controlling Representative and the conditions set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, may take certain actions to mitigate losses on a Mortgage Loan which may include, but are not limited to, forgiving certain payments of principal and/or interest on a Mortgage</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Loan in connection with a modification or refinancing (including short refinancings) or modifying the payment terms of a Mortgage Note. Such action by the Servicer may reduce the amount available for distribution to the Offered Certificates. See “<i>Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Servicing of Defaulted Mortgage Loans</i>” in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The yield to maturity of the Offered Certificates will be sensitive in varying degrees to the rate and timing of principal payments (including prepayments) on the Mortgage Loans. Investors in the Offered Certificates should consider the associated risks, including, in the case of P&amp;I Certificates purchased at a discount, the risk that a slower than anticipated rate of distributions in respect of principal (including prepayments) on the Mortgage Loans may have a negative effect on the yield to maturity of such Offered Certificates and, in the case of P&amp;I Certificates purchased at a premium (and the Class A-IO-S Certificates), the risk that a faster than anticipated rate of payments in respect of principal (including prepayments) on the Mortgage Loans may have a negative effect on the yield to maturity of such Offered Certificates.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If you are purchasing Class B-X Certificates, which are the most subordinated class of Certificates, in addition to the negative effect on the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution of a rapid rate of prepayments, the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution is also extremely sensitive to unscheduled recoveries of principal, including Liquidation Proceeds, as the distribution priorities allocate Monthly Excess Cashflow that would otherwise be distributed as the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution instead to make distributions on the P&amp;I Certificates (including on the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class B-X Certificates), up to the amount of Realized Losses during the related Prepayment Period and Applied Realized Loss Amounts allocated on prior Distribution Dates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">An investor is urged to make an investment decision with respect to an Offered Certificate based on the anticipated yield to maturity resulting from its purchase price and such investor’s own determination as to the anticipated Mortgage Loan prepayment rates under a variety of scenarios.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The timing of changes in the rate of prepayment on the Mortgage Loans may significantly affect the actual yield to maturity experienced by a holder of an Offered Certificate at a price other than par, even if the average rate of principal payments experienced over time is consistent with such holder’s expectation. In general, the earlier a prepayment of principal on the underlying Mortgage Loans, the greater the effect on such holder’s yield to maturity. As a result, the effect on such holder’s yield of principal payments occurring at a rate higher (or lower) than the rate anticipated by such holder during the period immediately following the issuance of the Offered Certificates would not be fully offset by a subsequent like reduction (or increase) in the rate of principal payments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The yield to maturity on the Offered Certificates may be affected by the geographic concentration of the Mortgaged Properties securing the Mortgage Loans. Certain regions of the United States from time to time will experience weaker economic conditions or might experience weaker housing markets or inflated housing prices and, consequently, will experience higher rates of delinquency, foreclosure and loss than experienced nationwide. In addition, certain regions have experienced or may experience natural disasters, including earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes, which may adversely affect property values. The terms of these Mortgage Loans were extended to account for a forbearance period during which the mortgagors were not required to make scheduled monthly payments. Any deterioration of economic conditions in the regions in which there is a significant concentration of Mortgaged Properties which adversely affects the ability of mortgagors to make payments on the Mortgage Loans may increase the likelihood of delinquencies and losses on the Mortgage Loans. Such delinquencies and losses will have an adverse effect on the yield to maturity of the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">On any business day on or after the two year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Depositor may, at its option, purchase all of the outstanding Certificates as described above under “<i>Description of the Certificates— Optional Redemption.</i>” If the Depositor elects to purchase all of the outstanding Certificates, this will have the effect of a prepayment in full of the aggregate Certificate Principal Balance of the Offered Certificates to all Certificateholders at such time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A modification that extends the term of a Mortgage Loan will also result in a slower rate of principal payments. A modification may also result in less interest accruing on a Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">No representation is made as to the rate of principal payments on the Mortgage Loans or as to the yield to maturity of the Offered Certificates.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Weighted Average Lives of the Offered Certificates</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The “<b>Weighted Average Life</b>” of a class of P&amp;I Certificates is determined by (i) multiplying the assumed net reduction, if any, in the Certificate Principal Balance on each Distribution Date of such class of Certificates by the number of years from the date of issuance of such class of Certificates to the related Distribution Date, (ii) summing the results, and (iii) dividing the sum by the aggregate amount of the assumed net reductions in the Certificate Principal Balance of such class of Certificates. Because it is expected that there will be prepayments, defaults and modifications on the Mortgage Loans, the actual Weighted Average Life of a class of P&amp;I Certificates is expected to vary substantially from the weighted average remaining terms to maturity of the Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prepayments on mortgage loans are commonly measured relative to a prepayment model or standard.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">There is no assurance that prepayments of the Mortgage Loans will conform to any level of the prepayment model. A number of factors, including but not limited to homeowner mobility, economic conditions, natural disasters, changes in mortgagors’ housing needs, job transfers, unemployment or, in the case of mortgagors relying on commission income and self-employed mortgagors, significant fluctuations in income or adverse economic conditions, mortgagors’ net equity in the properties securing the Mortgage Loans, the use of second or “home equity” mortgage loans by mortgagors, servicing decisions, enforceability of due  on sale clauses, modifications, mortgage market interest rates, mortgage recording taxes, competition among mortgage loan originators resulting in reduced refinancing costs and the availability of mortgage funds, may affect prepayment and liquidation experience. In general, however, if prevailing mortgage rates fall below the Mortgage Interest Rates borne by the Mortgage Loans, it would be expected that more mortgagors would refinance their mortgage obligations and repay their Mortgage Loans and that the prepayment rates of the Mortgage Loans would therefore be higher than if prevailing rates remain at or above the rates borne by such Mortgage Loans. Conversely, if prevailing mortgage rates rise above the Mortgage Interest Rates borne by the Mortgage Loans, it would be expected that fewer mortgagors would refinance their mortgage obligations and repay their Mortgage Loans and that the prepayment rates of the Mortgage Loans would therefore be lower than if prevailing rates remain at or below such Mortgage Interest Rates. However, there can be no assurance that prepayments will rise or fall according to such changes in mortgage rates. The amount of equity in a Mortgaged Property may also affect the rate of prepayments because as the amount of equity in the Mortgaged Property increases, the related mortgagor may be more likely to enter into a “cash out” refinancing of the Mortgaged Property (if such refinancing is available), which will result in a prepayment in full of the Mortgage Loan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Prepayments on the Mortgage Loans will also be affected by the obligation of the Representation Provider to repurchase certain of the Mortgage Loans under certain circumstances, Optional Purchases, the right of the Servicer (at the direction of the Servicing Administrator) to exercise of the Optional Termination and the right of the Depositor to purchase all of the Certificates on any business day occurring on or after the two year anniversary of the Closing Date.

64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The following discussion contains summaries, which are general in nature, of certain state law legal aspects of loans secured by single family residential properties and REO properties. Because such legal aspects are governed primarily by the applicable laws of the state in which the related Mortgaged Property or REO property is located (which laws may differ substantially), the summaries do not purport to be complete nor to reflect the laws of any particular state, nor to encompass the laws of all states in which the Mortgaged Properties and REO properties are situated. The summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable federal and state laws governing the Mortgage Loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">All of the Mortgage Loans are loans evidenced by a note or bond and secured by instruments granting a security interest in real property which may be mortgages, deeds of trust, security deeds or deeds to secure debt, depending upon the prevailing practice and law in the state in which the Mortgaged Property is located. Mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt are in this Offering Memorandum collectively referred to as “mortgages.” Any of the foregoing types of mortgages will create a lien upon, or grant a title interest in, the subject property, the priority of which will depend on the terms of the particular security instrument, as well as separate, recorded, contractual arrangements with others holding interests in the mortgaged property, the knowledge of the parties to such instrument as well as the order of recordation of the instrument in the appropriate public recording office. However, recording does not generally establish priority over governmental claims for real estate taxes and assessments and other charges imposed under governmental police powers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Types of Mortgage Instruments</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">A mortgage either creates a lien against or constitutes a conveyance of real property between two parties</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">– a mortgagor, who is usually the owner of the subject property (or, in the case of a Mortgage Loan secured by a property that has been conveyed to an <i>inter vivos </i>revocable trust, the settlor of such trust) – and a mortgagee. In a mortgage instrument state, the mortgagor delivers to the mortgagee a note or bond evidencing the mortgage loan and the mortgage. In contrast, a deed of trust is a three party instrument, among a trustor (the equivalent of a mortgagor), a trustee to whom the mortgaged property is conveyed, and a beneficiary (the mortgagee) for whose benefit the conveyance is made. As used in this Offering Memorandum, unless the context otherwise requires, “mortgagor” includes the trustor under a deed of trust and a grantor under a security deed or a deed to secure debt. Under a deed of trust, the mortgagor grants the property, irrevocably until the debt is paid, in trust, generally with a power of sale as security for the indebtedness evidenced by the related note. A deed to secure debt typically has two parties. By executing a deed to secure debt, the grantor conveys title to, as opposed to merely creating a lien upon, the subject property to the grantee until such time as the underlying debt is repaid, generally with a power of sale as security for the indebtedness evidenced by the related Mortgage Note. In case the mortgagor under a mortgage is a land trust, there would be an additional party because legal title to the property is held by a land trustee under a land trust agreement for the benefit of the mortgagor. At origination of a mortgage loan involving a land trust, the mortgagor executes a separate undertaking to make payments on the Mortgage Note. The mortgagee’s authority under a mortgage, the trustee’s authority under a deed of trust and the grantee’s authority under a deed to secure debt are governed by the express provisions of the mortgage, the law of the state in which the real property is located, certain federal laws (including, without limitation, the Relief Act) and, in some cases, in deed of trust transactions, the directions of the beneficiary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Interest in Real Property</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The real property covered by a mortgage, deed of trust, security deed or deed to secure debt is most often the fee estate in land and improvements. However, such an instrument may encumber other interests in real property such as a tenant’s interest in a lease of land or improvements, or both, and the leasehold estate created by such lease. An instrument covering an interest in real property other than the fee estate requires special provisions in the instrument creating such interest or in the mortgage, deed of trust, security deed or deed to secure debt, to protect the mortgagee against termination of such interest before the mortgage, deed of trust, security deed or deed to secure debt is paid.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Condominiums</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certain of the Mortgage Loans are loans secured by condominium units. The condominium building may be a multi-unit building or buildings, or a group of buildings whether or not attached to each other, located on</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">property subject to condominium ownership. Condominium ownership is a form of ownership of real property as to which each owner is entitled to the exclusive ownership and possession of his or her individual condominium unit. The owner also owns a proportionate undivided interest in all parts of the condominium building (other than the other individual condominium units) and all areas or facilities, if any, for the common use of the condominium units. The condominium unit owners appoint or elect the condominium association to govern the affairs of the condominium.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Foreclosure</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Foreclosure is a legal procedure that allows the mortgagee to recover its mortgage debt by enforcing its rights and available legal remedies under the mortgage. If the mortgagor defaults in payment or performance of its obligations under the note or mortgage, the mortgagee has the right to institute foreclosure proceedings to sell the mortgaged property at public auction to satisfy the indebtedness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Foreclosure procedures with respect to the enforcement of a mortgage vary from state to state. Two primary methods of foreclosing a mortgage are judicial foreclosure and non-judicial foreclosure pursuant to a power of sale granted in the mortgage instrument. There are several other foreclosure procedures available in some states that are either infrequently used or available only in certain limited circumstances, such as strict foreclosure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In response to an unusually large number of foreclosures in recent years, a growing number of states have enacted laws that subject the holder to certain notice and/or waiting periods prior to commencing a foreclosure. In Massachusetts, the Attorney General’s office may review and possibly terminate the foreclosure of any one-to-four family residential mortgage that is the mortgagor’s principal dwelling. In some instances, these laws require the servicer of the mortgage to consider modification of the mortgage or an alternative option prior to proceeding with foreclosure. The effect of these laws has been to delay foreclosures in particular jurisdictions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">See “<i>Risk Factors— Governmental and Other Actions May Affect Servicing of the Mortgage Loans and May Limit the Servicer’s Ability to Foreclose</i>” for a description of recent developments regarding foreclosure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Judicial Foreclosure</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A judicial foreclosure proceeding is conducted in a court having jurisdiction over the mortgaged property. Generally, the action is initiated by the service of legal pleadings upon all parties having an interest of record in the real property. Delays in completion of the foreclosure may occasionally result from difficulties in locating defendants. When the mortgagee’s right to foreclose is contested, the legal proceedings can be time consuming. Upon successful completion of a judicial foreclosure proceeding, the court generally issues a judgment of foreclosure and appoints a referee or other officer to conduct a public sale of the mortgaged property, the proceeds of which are used to satisfy the judgment. Such sales are made in accordance with procedures that vary from state to state.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Equitable Limitations on Enforceability of Certain Provisions</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">United States courts have traditionally imposed general equitable principles to limit the remedies available to a mortgagee in connection with foreclosure. These equitable principles are generally designed to relieve the mortgagor from the legal effect of mortgage defaults, to the extent that such effect is perceived as harsh or unfair. Relying on such principles, a court may alter the specific terms of a loan to the extent it considers necessary to prevent or remedy an injustice, undue oppression or overreaching, or may require the mortgagee to undertake affirmative and expensive actions to determine the cause of the mortgagor’s default and the likelihood that the mortgagor will be able to reinstate the loan. In some cases, courts have substituted their judgment for the mortgagee’s and have required that mortgagees reinstate loans or recast payment schedules in order to accommodate mortgagors who are suffering from a temporary financial disability. In other cases, courts have limited the right of the mortgagee to foreclose if the default under the mortgage is not monetary, <i>e.g., </i>the mortgagor failed to maintain the mortgaged property adequately or the mortgagor executed a junior mortgage on the mortgaged property. The exercise by the court of its equity powers will depend on the individual circumstances of each case presented to it. Finally, some courts have been faced with the issue of whether federal or state constitutional provisions reflecting due process concerns for adequate notice require that a mortgagor receive notice in addition to statutorily prescribed minimum notice. For the most part, these cases have upheld the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reasonableness of the notice provisions or have found that a public sale under a mortgage providing for a power of sale does not involve sufficient state action to afford constitutional protections to the mortgagor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Non Judicial Foreclosure/Power of Sale</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Foreclosure of a deed of trust is generally accomplished by a non-judicial trustee’s sale pursuant to the power of sale granted in the deed of trust. A power of sale is typically granted in a deed of trust. It may also be contained in any other type of mortgage instrument. A power of sale allows a non-judicial public sale to be conducted generally following a request from the beneficiary/mortgagee to the trustee to sell the property upon any default by the mortgagor under the terms of the Mortgage Note or the mortgage instrument and after notice of sale is given in accordance with the terms of the mortgage instrument, as well as applicable state law. In some states, prior to such sale, the trustee under a deed of trust must record a notice of default and notice of sale and send a copy to the mortgagor and to any other party who has recorded a request for a copy of a notice of default and notice of sale. In addition, in some states the trustee must provide notice to any other party having an interest of record in the real property, including junior lienholders. A notice of sale must be posted in a public place and, in most states, published for a specified period of time in one or more newspapers. The mortgagor or junior lienholder may then have the right, during a reinstatement period required in some states, to cure the default by paying the entire actual amount in arrears (without acceleration) plus the expenses incurred in enforcing the obligation. In other states, the mortgagor or the junior lienholder is not provided a period to reinstate the loan, but has only the right to pay off the entire debt to prevent the foreclosure sale. Generally, the procedure for public sale, the parties entitled to notice, the method of giving notice and the applicable time periods are governed by state law and vary among the states. Foreclosure of a deed to secure debt is also generally accomplished by a non- judicial sale similar to that required by a deed of trust, except that the mortgagee or its agent, rather than a trustee, is typically empowered to perform the sale in accordance with the terms of the deed to secure debt and applicable law.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Public Sale</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A third party may be unwilling to purchase a mortgaged property at a public sale because of the difficulty in determining the value of such property at the time of sale, due to, among other things, redemption rights which may exist and the possibility of physical deterioration of the property during the foreclosure proceedings. For these reasons, it is common for the mortgagee to purchase the mortgaged property for an amount equal to or less than the underlying debt and accrued and unpaid interest plus the expenses of foreclosure. Generally, state law controls the amount of foreclosure costs and expenses which may be recovered by a mortgagee. Thereafter, subject to the mortgagor’s right in some states to remain in possession during a redemption period, if applicable, the mortgagee will become the owner of the property and have both the benefits and burdens of ownership of the mortgaged property. For example, the mortgagee will become obligated to pay taxes, obtain casualty insurance and to make such repairs at its own expense as are necessary to render the property suitable for sale. The mortgagee will commonly obtain the services of a real estate broker and pay the broker’s commission in connection with the sale of the property. Depending upon market conditions, the ultimate proceeds of the sale of the property may not equal the mortgagee’s investment in the property. Moreover, a mortgagee commonly incurs substantial legal fees and court costs in acquiring a mortgaged property through contested foreclosure and/or bankruptcy proceedings. Generally, state law controls the amount of foreclosure expenses and costs, including attorneys’ fees, that may be recovered by a mortgagee.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A junior mortgagee may not foreclose on the property securing the junior mortgage unless it forecloses subject to senior mortgages and any other prior liens, in which case it may be obliged to make payments on the senior mortgages to avoid their foreclosure. In addition, in the event that the foreclosure of a junior mortgage triggers the enforcement of a “due on sale” clause contained in a senior mortgage, the junior mortgagee may be required to pay the full amount of the senior mortgage to avoid its foreclosure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The proceeds received by the referee or trustee from the sale are applied first to the costs, fees and expenses of sale and then in satisfaction of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage under which the sale was conducted. Any proceeds remaining after satisfaction of senior mortgage debt are generally payable to the holders of junior mortgages and other liens and claims in order of their priority, whether or not the mortgagor is in default. Any additional proceeds are generally payable to the mortgagor. The payment of the proceeds to the holders of junior mortgages may occur in the foreclosure action of the senior mortgage or a subsequent ancillary proceeding or may require the institution of separate legal proceedings by such holders.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rights of Redemption</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The purposes of a foreclosure action are to enable the mortgagee to realize upon its security and to bar the mortgagor, and all persons who have an interest in the property which is subordinate to the mortgage being foreclosed, from exercise of their “equity of redemption.” The doctrine of equity of redemption provides that, until the property covered by a mortgage has been sold in accordance with a properly conducted foreclosure and foreclosure sale, those having an interest which is subordinate to that of the foreclosing mortgagee have an equity of redemption and may redeem the property by paying the entire debt with interest. In addition, in some states, when a foreclosure action has been commenced, the redeeming party must pay certain costs of such action. Those having an equity of redemption must generally be made parties and joined in the foreclosure proceeding in order for their equity of redemption to be cut off and terminated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The equity of redemption is a common law (non-statutory) right which exists prior to completion of the foreclosure, is not waivable by the mortgagor, must be exercised prior to foreclosure sale and should be distinguished from the post-sale statutory rights of redemption. In some states, after sale pursuant to a deed of trust or foreclosure of a mortgage, the mortgagor and foreclosed junior lienors are given a statutory period in which to redeem the property from the foreclosure sale. In some states, statutory redemption may occur only upon payment of the foreclosure sale price. In other states, redemption may be authorized if the former mortgagor pays only a portion of the sums due. The effect of a statutory right of redemption is to diminish the ability of the mortgagee to sell the foreclosed property. The exercise of a right of redemption would defeat the title of any purchaser from a foreclosure sale or sale under a deed of trust. Consequently, the practical effect of the redemption right is to force the mortgagee to maintain the property and pay the expenses of ownership until the redemption period has expired. In some states, a post-sale statutory right of redemption may exist following a judicial foreclosure, but not following a trustee’s sale under a deed of trust.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anti-Deficiency Legislation, the Bankruptcy Code and Other Limitations on Mortgagees</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Statutes in some states limit the right of a beneficiary under a deed of trust or a mortgagee under a mortgage to obtain a deficiency judgment against the mortgagor following foreclosure or sale under a deed of trust. A deficiency judgment would be a personal judgment against the former mortgagor equal to the difference between the net amount realized upon the public sale of the real property and the amount due to the mortgagee. Some states require the mortgagee to exhaust the security afforded under a mortgage by foreclosure in an attempt to satisfy the full debt before bringing a personal action against the mortgagor. In certain other states, the mortgagee has the option of bringing a personal action against the mortgagor on the debt without first exhausting such security; however, in some of these states, the mortgagee, following judgment on such personal action, may be deemed to have elected a remedy and may be precluded from exercising remedies with respect to the security. In some cases, a mortgagee will be precluded from exercising any additional rights under the note or mortgage if it has taken any prior enforcement action. Consequently, the practical effect of the election requirement, in those states permitting such election, is that mortgagees will usually proceed against the security first rather than bringing a personal action against the mortgagor. Finally, other statutory provisions limit any deficiency judgment against the former mortgagor following a judicial sale to the excess of the outstanding debt over the fair market value of the property at the time of the public sale. The purpose of these statutes is generally to prevent a mortgagee from obtaining a large deficiency judgment against the former mortgagor as a result of low or no bids at the judicial sale.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to laws limiting or prohibiting deficiency judgments, numerous other federal and state statutory provisions, including the federal bankruptcy laws and state laws affording relief to debtors, may interfere with or affect the ability of the secured mortgage mortgagee to realize upon collateral or enforce a deficiency judgment. For example, under the Bankruptcy Code, virtually all actions (including foreclosure actions and deficiency judgment proceedings) are automatically stayed upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition, and, usually, no interest or principal payments are made during the course of the bankruptcy case. Foreclosure of an interest in real property of a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code can typically occur only if the bankruptcy court vacates the stay, an action, the court may be reluctant to take, particularly if the debtor has the prospect of restructuring his or her debts and the mortgage collateral is not deteriorating in value. The delay and the consequences of such delay caused by such automatic stay can be significant. Also, under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or on behalf of a junior lienor (a subordinate mortgagee secured by a mortgage on the property) may stay a senior mortgagee from taking action to foreclose.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A homeowner may typically file for relief under the Bankruptcy Code under any one of three different chapters of the Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 7, the assets of the debtor (that are not exempt from execution</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to satisfy a money judgment) are liquidated and a mortgagee secured by a lien may usually “bid in” (<i>i.e., </i>bid up to the amount of the debt) at the sale of the asset. See “—<i>Foreclosure</i>” above. A homeowner may also file for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and reorganize his or her debts through his or her reorganization plan. Alternatively, a homeowner may file for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code and address his or her debts in a rehabilitation plan. (Chapter 13 is often referred to as the “wage earner chapter” or “consumer chapter” because most individuals seeking to restructure their debts file for relief under Chapter 13 rather than Chapter 11).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Bankruptcy Code permits a mortgage loan that is secured by property that does not consist solely of the debtor’s principal residence to be modified without the consent of the mortgagee provided certain substantive and procedural safeguards are met. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the mortgagee’s security interest may be reduced to the then current value of the property as determined by the court if the value is less than the amount due on the loan, thereby leaving the mortgagee as a general unsecured creditor for the difference between the then-current value of the collateral and the outstanding balance of the mortgage loan. A mortgagor’s unsecured indebtedness will typically be discharged in full with or without payment of a substantially reduced amount. Other modifications to a mortgage loan may include a reduction in the amount of each monthly payment, which reduction may result from one or more of the following, a reduction in the rate of interest, an alteration of the repayment schedule, an extension of the final maturity date, or a reduction in the outstanding balance of the secured portion of the loan. In certain circumstances, subject to the court’s approval, liens senior to the lien of a mortgage may be granted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A reorganization plan under Chapter 11 and a rehabilitation plan under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code may each allow a debtor to cure a default with respect to a mortgage loan on such debtor’s residence by paying arrearages over a period of time and to decelerate and reinstate the original mortgage loan payment schedule, even though the mortgagee accelerated the loan and a final judgment of foreclosure had been entered in state court (<i>provided </i>no sale of the property had yet occurred) prior to the filing of the debtor’s petition under the Bankruptcy Code. Under a Chapter 13 plan, curing of defaults and arrearages must be accomplished within the five year maximum term permitted for repayment plans, such term commencing when repayment plan becomes effective, while defaults may be cured over a longer period of time under a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. Plans in both Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 can provide for an extension of the maturity of the mortgage loan beyond the five year period described above.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Generally, a repayment plan in a case under Chapter 13 and a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 may not modify the claim of a mortgagee if the mortgagor elects to retain the property, the property is the mortgagor’s principal residence and the property is the mortgagee’s only collateral. Certain courts have allowed modifications when the mortgage loan is secured both by the debtor’s principal residence and by collateral that is not “inextricably bound” to the real property, such as appliances, machinery, or furniture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The general protection for mortgages secured only by the debtor’s principal residence is not applicable in a case under Chapter 13 if the last payment on the original payment schedule is due before the final date for payment under the debtor’s Chapter 13 plan (which date could be up to five years after the debtor emerges from bankruptcy). Under several recently decided cases, the terms of such a loan can be modified in the manner described above. While these decisions are contrary to the holding in a prior case by a senior appellate court, it is possible that the later decisions will become the accepted interpretation in view of the language of the applicable statutory provision.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If this interpretation is adopted by a court considering the treatment in a Chapter 13 repayment plan of a Mortgage Loan, it is possible that the Mortgage Loan could be modified.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">State statutes and general principles of equity may also provide a mortgagor with means to halt a foreclosure proceeding or sale and to force a restructuring of a mortgage loan on terms a mortgagee would not otherwise accept.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In a bankruptcy or similar proceeding of a mortgagor, action may be taken seeking the recovery, as a preferential transfer or on other grounds, of any payments made by the mortgagor under the related mortgage loan prior to the bankruptcy or similar proceeding. Distributions on long term debt may be protected from recovery as preferences if they are payments in the ordinary course of business made on debts incurred in the ordinary course of business or if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt at the time of payment. Whether any particular payment would be protected depends upon the facts specific to a particular transaction.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A trustee in bankruptcy, in some cases, may be entitled to collect its costs and expenses in preserving or selling the mortgaged property ahead of a payment to the mortgagee. Moreover, the laws of certain states also give priority to certain tax and mechanics liens over the lien of a mortgage. Under the Bankruptcy Code, if the court finds that actions of the mortgagee have been unreasonable and inequitable, the lien of the related mortgage may be subordinated to the claims of unsecured creditors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Code provides priority to certain tax liens over the lien of the mortgage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Forfeiture for Drug, RICO and Money Laundering Violations</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Federal law provides that property purchased or improved with assets derived from criminal activity or otherwise tainted, or used in the commission of certain offenses, can be seized and ordered forfeited to the United States of America. The offenses which can trigger such a seizure and forfeiture include, among others, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and the regulations issued thereunder, as well as the narcotic drug laws. In many instances, the United States may seize the property even before a conviction occurs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In the event of a forfeiture proceeding, a mortgagee may be able to establish its interest in the property by proving that (i) its mortgage was executed and recorded before the commission of the illegal conduct from which the assets used to purchase or improve the property were derived or before the commission of any other crime upon which the forfeiture is based, or (ii) the mortgagee, at the time of the execution of the mortgage, “did not know or was reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture.” However, there can be no assurance that such a defense will be successful.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Servicemembers Civil Relief Act</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Generally, under the terms of the Relief Act, a mortgagor who enters military service after the origination of such mortgagor’s Mortgage Loan (including a mortgagor who is a member of the National Guard or is in reserve status at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan and is later called to active duty) may not be charged interest, including fees and charges, above an annual rate of 6% during the period of such mortgagor’s active duty status and for one year thereafter. In addition to adjusting the interest, the mortgagee must forgive any such interest in excess of 6% per annum, unless a court or administrative agency orders otherwise upon application of the mortgagee. It is possible that such action could have an effect, for an indeterminate period of time, on the ability of the Servicer to collect full amounts of interest on certain of the Mortgage Loans. Any shortfall in interest collections resulting from the application of the Relief Act or any amendment to it will make it more likely that the Net WAC Rate will apply to one or more classes of Certificates, and under certain scenarios, amounts received in respect of the Mortgage Loans may be insufficient to pay the Certificates all principal and interest to which they are entitled. Further, the Relief Act imposes limitations which may impair the ability of the servicers to foreclose on an affected Mortgage Loan during the mortgagor’s period of active duty status and up to nine months thereafter. Thus, in the event that such a Mortgage Loan goes into default, there may be delays and losses occasioned by the inability to realize upon the mortgaged property in a timely fashion. In addition, the Relief Act provides broad discretion for a court to modify a Mortgage Loan upon application of the mortgagor. Certain states have enacted comparable legislation which may lead to the modification of a Mortgage Loan or interfere with or affect the ability of the servicers to timely collect payments of principal and interest on, or to foreclose on, Mortgage Loans of mortgagors in such states who are active or reserve members of the armed services or the national guard. For example, California has enacted legislation providing protection substantially similar to that provided by the Relief Act to California national guard members called up for active service by the Governor or President and to reservists called to active duty.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Environmental Considerations</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A mortgagee may be subject to unforeseen environmental risks when taking a security interest in real or personal property or by owning real property, as the case may be. Properties may be subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Such laws may regulate, among other things: emissions of air pollutants; discharges of wastewater or storm water; generation, transport, storage or disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances; operation, closure and removal of underground storage tanks; removal and disposal of asbestos containing materials; management of electrical or other equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (“<b>PCBs</b>”). Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in significant penalties, including civil and criminal fines. Under the laws of certain states, environmental contamination on a property may give rise to a lien on the property to ensure the availability and/or reimbursement of costs of remedial</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">action (“<b>Cleanup Costs</b>”). Generally all subsequent liens on such property are subordinated to such a lien and, in some states, even prior recorded liens are subordinated to such liens (“<b>Superliens</b>”). In the latter states, the security interest of the Trustee in a property that is subject to such a Superlien could be adversely affected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (“<b>CERCLA</b>”), and under state law in certain states, a party which takes a deed in lieu of foreclosure, purchases a mortgaged property at a foreclosure sale, operates a mortgaged property or undertakes certain types of activities that may constitute management of the mortgaged property may become liable in certain circumstances for the Cleanup Costs if hazardous wastes or hazardous substances have been released or disposed of on the property. Such Cleanup Costs may be substantial and could exceed the value of the property and the aggregate assets of the owner or operator. CERCLA imposes strict, as well as joint and several liability for environmental remediation and/or damage costs on several classes of “potentially responsible parties,” including current “owners and/or operators” of property, irrespective of whether those owners or operators caused or contributed to contamination on the property. In addition, owners and operators of properties that generate hazardous substances that are disposed of at other “offsite” locations may be held strictly, jointly and severally liable for environmental remediation and/or damages at those off site locations. Many states also have laws that are similar to CERCLA. Liability under CERCLA or under similar state law could exceed the value of the property itself as well as the aggregate assets of the property owner.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The law is unclear as to whether and under what precise circumstances Cleanup Costs, or the obligation to take remedial actions, could be imposed on a secured mortgagee. Under the laws of some states and under CERCLA, a mortgagee may be liable as an “owner or operator” for costs of addressing releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances on a mortgaged property if such mortgagee or its agents or employees have “participated in the management” of the operations of the mortgagor, even though the environmental damage or threat was caused by a prior owner or current owner or operator or other third party. Excluded from CERCLA’s definition of “owner or operator,” is a person “who without participating in the management of . . . [the] facility, holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect his security interest” (the “<b>secured creditor exemption</b>”). This exemption for holders of a security interest such as a secured mortgagee applies only to the extent that a mortgagee seeks to protect its security interest in the contaminated facility or property. Thus, if a mortgagee’s activities begin to encroach on the actual management of such facility or property, the mortgagee faces potential liability as an “owner or operator” under CERCLA. Similarly, when a mortgagee forecloses and takes title to a contaminated facility or property, the mortgagee may incur potential CERCLA liability in various circumstances including, among others, when it holds the facility or property as an investment (including leasing the facility or property to a third party), fails to market the property in a timely fashion or fails to properly address environmental conditions at the property or facility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“<b>RCRA</b>”), contains a similar secured creditor exemption for those mortgagees who hold a security interest in a petroleum underground storage tank (“<b>UST</b>”) or in real estate containing a UST, or that acquire title to a petroleum UST or facility or property on which such a UST is located. As under CERCLA, a mortgagee may lose its secured creditor exemption and be held liable under RCRA as a UST owner or operator if such mortgagee or its employees or agents participate in the management of the UST. In addition, if the mortgagee takes title to or possession of the UST or the real estate containing the UST, under certain circumstances the secured creditor exemption may be deemed to be unavailable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">A decision in May 1990 of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in <i>United States</i></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">v. Fleet Factors Corp. <span class="p">very narrowly construed CERCLA’s secured creditor exemption. The court’s opinion suggested that a mortgagee need not have involved itself in the day to day operations of the facility or participated in decisions relating to hazardous waste to be liable under CERCLA, rather, liability could attach to a mortgagee if its involvement with the management of the facility were broad enough to support the inference that the mortgagee had the capacity to influence the mortgagor’s treatment of hazardous waste. The court added that a mortgagee’s capacity to influence such decisions could be inferred from the extent of its involvement in the facility’s financial management. A subsequent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in </span>In re Bergsoe Metal Corp., <span class="p">apparently disagreeing with, but not expressly contradicting, the Fleet Factors court, held that a secured mortgagee had no liability absent “some actual management of the facility” on the part of the mortgagee.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Court decisions have taken varying views of the scope of the secured creditor exemption, leading to administrative and legislative efforts to provide guidance to mortgagees on the scope of activities that would trigger CERCLA and/or RCRA liability. On September 30, 1996, however, the Asset Conservation Lender Liability and Deposit Insurance Protection Act of 1996 (the “<b>Asset Conservation Act</b>”) was enacted. The Asset</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Conservation Act was intended to clarify the scope of the secured creditor exemption under both CERCLA and RCRA. The Asset Conservation Act more explicitly defined the kinds of “participation in management” that would trigger liability under CERCLA and specified certain activities that would not constitute “participation in management” or otherwise result in a forfeiture of the secured creditor exemption prior to foreclosure or during a workout period. The Asset Conservation Act also clarified the extent of protection against liability under CERCLA in the event of foreclosure and authorized certain regulatory clarifications of the scope of the secured creditor exemption for purposes of RCRA, similar to the statutory protections under CERCLA. However, since the courts have not yet had the opportunity to interpret the new statutory provisions, the scope of the additional protections offered by the Asset Conservation Act is not fully defined. It also is important to note that the Asset Conservation Act does not offer complete protection to mortgagees and that the risk of liability remains.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If a secured mortgagee does become liable, it may be entitled to bring an action for contribution against the owner or operator who created the environmental contamination or against some other liable party, but that person or entity may be bankrupt or otherwise judgment proof. It is therefore possible that cleanup or other environmental liability costs could become a liability of the Issuing Entity and occasion a loss to the Issuing Entity and to the Certificateholders in certain circumstances. The secured creditor amendments to CERCLA, also, would not necessarily affect the potential for liability in actions by either a state or a private party under other federal or state laws which may impose liability on “owners or operators” but do not incorporate the secured creditor exemption.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Traditionally, residential loan mortgagees have not taken steps to evaluate whether hazardous wastes or hazardous substances are present with respect to any mortgaged property prior to the origination of the mortgage loan or prior to foreclosure or accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Custodian, the Sponsor, the Representation Provider, the Seller, the Depositor, the Servicing Administrator, the Servicer or the Master Servicer is required to undertake any such evaluations prior to foreclosure or accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Custodian, the Sponsor, the Representation Provider, the Seller, the Depositor, the Servicing Administrator, the Servicer or the Master Servicer makes any representations or warranties or assumes any liability with respect to: the environmental condition of any Mortgaged Property; the absence, presence or effect of hazardous wastes or hazardous substances on any Mortgaged Property; any casualty resulting from the presence or effect of hazardous wastes or hazardous substances on, near or emanating from such Mortgaged Property; the impact on Certificateholders of any environmental condition or presence of any substance on or near such Mortgaged Property; or the compliance of any Mortgaged Property with any environmental laws, nor is any agent, person or entity otherwise affiliated with the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Custodian, the Sponsor, the Representation Provider, the Seller, the Depositor, the Servicing Administrator, the Servicer or the Master Servicer authorized or able to make any such representation, warranty or assumption of liability relative to any such Mortgaged Property.

Some court decisions and legislative actions placed substantial restrictions on the right of mortgagees to enforce such clauses in many states. However, effective October 15, 1982, Congress enacted the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 (the “<b>Garn Act</b>”) which purports to preempt state laws which prohibit the enforcement of “due-on-sale” clauses by providing among other matters, that “due-on-sale” clauses in certain loans (which loans may include the Mortgage Loans) made after the effective date of the Garn Act are enforceable, within certain limitations as set forth in the Garn Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. “Due-on-sale” clauses contained in mortgage loans originated by federal savings and loan associations, federal savings banks, national banks and federal credit union are fully enforceable pursuant to regulations of the OCC and the National Credit Union Administration, which preempt state law restrictions on the enforcement of such clauses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Garn Act created a limited exemption from its general rule of enforceability for “due-on-sale” clauses in certain mortgage loans (“<b>Window Period Loans</b>”) which were originated by non-federal mortgagees and made or assumed in certain states (“<b>Window Period States</b>”) during the period, prior to October 15, 1982, in which that state prohibited the enforcement of “due-on-sale” clauses by constitutional provision, statute or statewide court decision (the “<b>Window Period</b>”). Though neither the Garn Act nor the OCC regulations actually names the Window Period States, Freddie Mac has taken the position, in prescribing mortgage loan servicing</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">standards with respect to mortgage loans which it has purchased, that the Window Period States were: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Utah and Washington. Under the Garn Act, unless a Window Period State took action by October 15, 1985, the end of the Window Period, to further regulate enforcement of “due-on-sale” clauses in Window Period Loans, “due-on-sale” clauses would become enforceable even in Window Period Loans. Five of the Window Period States (Arizona, Minnesota, Michigan, New Mexico and Utah) have taken actions which restrict the enforceability of “due-on-sale” clauses in Window Period Loans beyond October 15, 1985. The actions taken vary among such states.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">By virtue of the Garn Act, the Servicer (subject to the consent rights of the Controlling Representative to the extent described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) may generally be permitted to accelerate any conventional Mortgage Loan which contains a “due-on-sale” clause upon transfer of an interest in the property subject to the mortgage or deed of trust. With respect to any Mortgage Loan secured by a residence occupied or to be occupied by the mortgagor, this ability to accelerate will not apply to certain types of transfers, including (i) the granting of a leasehold interest which has a term of three years or less and which does not contain an option to purchase, (ii) a transfer to a relative resulting from the death of a mortgagor, or a transfer where the spouse or children become an owner of the property in each case where the transferee(s) will occupy the property, (iii) a transfer resulting from a decree of dissolution of marriage, legal separation agreement or from an incidental property settlement agreement by which the spouse becomes an owner of the property, (iv) the creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the mortgagee’s security instrument which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property (<i>provided </i>that such lien or encumbrance is not created pursuant to a contract for deed), (v) a transfer by devise, descent or operation of law on the death of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety, (vi) a transfer into an <i>inter vivos </i>trust in which the mortgagor is the beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy; and (vii) other transfers as set forth in the Garn Act and the regulations thereunder. The extent of the effect of the Garn Act on the average lives and delinquency rates of the Mortgage Loans cannot be predicted.

First, the mortgagor may have difficulty servicing and repaying multiple loans. In addition, if the junior loan permits recourse to the mortgagor (as junior loans often do) and the senior loan does not, a mortgagor may be more likely to repay sums due on the junior loan than those on the senior loan. Second, acts of the senior mortgagee that prejudice the junior mortgagee or impair the junior mortgagee’s security may create a superior equity in favor of the junior mortgagee. For example, if the mortgagor and the senior mortgagee agree to an increase in the principal amount of or the interest rate payable on the senior loan, the senior mortgagee may lose its priority to the extent any existing junior mortgagee is harmed or the mortgagor is additionally burdened. Third, if the mortgagor defaults on the senior loan and/or any junior loan or loans, the existence of junior loans and actions taken by junior mortgagees can impair the security available to the senior mortgagee and can interfere with or delay the taking of action by the senior mortgagee. Moreover, the bankruptcy of a junior mortgagee may operate to stay foreclosure or similar proceedings by the senior mortgagee.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Applicability of State Usury Laws</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Title V of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, enacted in March 1980 (“<b>Title V</b>”), provides that state usury limitations will not apply to certain types of residential first mortgage loans originated by certain mortgagees after March 31, 1980. The OTS as successor to the FHLBB is authorized to issue rules and regulations and to publish interpretations governing implementation of Title V. The statute authorized any state to reimpose interest rate limits by adopting before April 1, 1983, a law or constitutional provision which expressly rejects application of the federal law. Fifteen states have adopted laws reimposing or reserving the right to reimpose interest rate limits. In addition, even where Title V is not so rejected, any state is authorized to adopt a provision limiting certain other loan charges.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Representation Provider will represent and warrant in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement that any and all requirements of any federal, state or local law applicable to the origination of the Mortgage Loans have been complied with in all material respects.

Examples of judicial remedies that may be fashioned include judicial requirements that the mortgagee undertake affirmative and expensive actions to determine the causes for the mortgagor’s default and the likelihood that the mortgagor will be able to reinstate the loan. In some cases, courts have substituted their judgment for the mortgagee’s judgment and have required mortgagees to reinstate loans or recast payment schedules to accommodate mortgagors who are suffering from temporary financial disability. In some cases, courts have limited the right of mortgagees to foreclose if the default under the mortgage instrument is not monetary, such as the mortgagor failing to adequately maintain the property or the mortgagor executing a second mortgage or deed of trust affecting the property. In other cases, some courts have been faced with the issue of whether federal or state constitutional provisions reflecting due process concerns for adequate notice require that mortgagors under the deeds of trust receive notices in addition to the statutorily prescribed minimum requirements. For the most part, these cases have upheld the notice provisions as being reasonable or have found that the sale by a trustee under a deed of trust or under a mortgage having a power of sale does not involve sufficient state action to afford constitutional protections to the mortgagor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alternative Mortgage Instruments</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Alternative mortgage instruments, including adjustable rate mortgage loans and early ownership mortgage loans, originated by non-federally chartered mortgagees have historically been subject to a variety of restrictions.

These difficulties were alleviated substantially as a result of the enactment of Title VIII of the Garn St Germain Act (“<b>Title VIII</b>”). Title VIII provides that, notwithstanding any state law to the contrary, state chartered banks may originate alternative mortgage instruments in accordance with regulations promulgated by the OCC with respect to origination of alternative mortgage instruments by national banks; state chartered credit unions may originate alternative mortgage instruments in accordance with regulations promulgated by the National Credit Union Administration with respect to origination of alternative mortgage instruments by federal credit unions; and all other non-federally chartered housing creditors, including state chartered savings and loan associations, state chartered savings banks and mutual savings banks and mortgage banking companies, may originate alternative mortgage instruments in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, predecessor to the Office of Thrift Supervision, with respect to origination of alternative mortgage instruments by federal savings and loan associations. Title VIII provides that any state may reject applicability of the provisions of Title VIII by adopting, prior to October 15, 1985, a law or constitutional provision expressly rejecting the applicability of such provisions.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause, to the extent provided in Treasury regulations, certain trusts that were in existence on August 20, 1996, that were treated as U.S. Tax Persons prior to such date, and that elect to continue to be treated as U.S. Tax Persons, also are U.S. Tax Persons.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of Offered Certificates, the treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner as a U.S. Tax Person or Non-U.S. Tax Person and upon the activities of the partnership. A Certificateholder of Offered Certificates that is a partnership and partners in such partnership should consult their tax advisors with regard to the application of the U.S. federal income tax law to their particular situations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Federal Income Tax Classifications</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Elections will be made to treat certain segregated portions of the assets of the Issuing Entity (exclusive of the assets, rights, obligations and arrangements excluded under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) as one or more REMICs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Upon the issuance of the Offered Certificates, Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, special U.S. federal income tax counsel to the Issuing Entity, will deliver its opinion generally to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) based in part on the facts set forth in the final Offering Memorandum and certain other additional information and representations and assuming their correctness, (ii) assuming compliance with all provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the other transaction documents without any waiver thereof, the making of proper and timely REMIC elections in accordance with the REMIC Provisions, and compliance with the Code, including the REMIC Provisions, and any changes in the Code and (iii) based on other customary assumptions, qualifications and carve outs, each REMIC for which an election is made pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will qualify as a REMIC, and the Offered Certificates (excluding for this purpose any of the assets, rights, obligations and arrangements excluded under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) will represent direct or indirect beneficial ownership of one or more REMIC regular interests. The Offered Certificates will generally be treated as representing beneficial ownership of debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes in respect of the REMIC regular interest portion of the related Certificates. The Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class M-1 and Class B-1 Certificates (collectively, the “<b>Capped Certificates</b>”) will also represent the right to receive distributions from the Cap Carryover Reserve Account and the Class B-X Certificates (collectively with the Capped Certificates, the “<b>Component Certificates</b>”) will also represent the obligation to pay amounts (solely to the extent of the Class B- X Additional Monthly Distribution) to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account. None of the rights or obligations in respect of payments to or distributions from the Cap Carryover Reserve Account will represent an interest in the REMIC regular interest portion of such Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Although the matter is not entirely clear, the Issuing Entity intends to treat the arrangement under which the Capped Certificates are entitled to receive distributions from the Cap Carryover Reserve Account and the Class B-X Certificates are obligated to pay amounts (solely to the extent of the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution) to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account as being in respect of a notional principal contract for U.S. federal income tax purposes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">As stated above, neither opinions of counsel nor positions taken by the Issuing Entity are a guarantee of any particular U.S. federal income tax result and are not binding on the IRS or any other third party. The IRS could take a contrary position to the opinions and positions described herein, resulting in material negative tax consequences to Certificateholders. If the IRS were to successfully contend that any REMIC were not a REMIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, consequences generally would be as discussed under “—<i>REMIC Qualification</i>” below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">For additional considerations in respect of the Component Certificates, see “—<i>Additional Considerations for the Component Certificates</i>” below. Except as otherwise provided in this “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” section of this Offering Memorandum, the following discussion describes only the REMIC regular interest portion of the Offered Certificates.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">REMIC Qualification</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In order for each REMIC to qualify as a REMIC, there must be ongoing compliance on the part of each REMIC with the requirements set forth in the Code. A REMIC must fulfill asset tests, which require that no more than a <i>de minimis </i>portion of the assets of the REMIC, as of the close of the third calendar month beginning after the “<b>Startup Day</b>” (which for purposes of this discussion is the date of the issuance of the Offered Certificates) and at all times thereafter, may consist of assets other than “qualified mortgages” and “permitted investments.” The REMIC Regulations provide a safe harbor pursuant to which the <i>de minimis </i>requirements will be met if at all times the aggregate adjusted basis of the nonqualified assets is less than one percent of the aggregate adjusted basis of all the REMIC’s assets. A REMIC also must provide “reasonable arrangements” to prevent its residual interest from being held by “disqualified organizations” or agents thereof and must furnish applicable tax information to transferors or agents that violate this requirement. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will provide that no legal or beneficial interest in the Class R Certificates may be transferred or registered unless certain conditions, designed to prevent violation of this requirement, are met.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A qualified mortgage is any obligation that is principally secured by an interest in real property and that is either transferred to the REMIC on the Startup Day or is purchased by the REMIC within a three-month period thereafter pursuant to a fixed price contract in effect on the Startup Day. A Mortgage Loan that is determined not to be a qualified mortgage must be disposed of within 90 days of discovery of such defect, or otherwise ceases to be a qualified mortgage after such 90-day period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Permitted investments include cash flow investments, qualified reserve assets and foreclosure property. A cash flow investment is an investment, earning a return in the nature of interest, of amounts received on or with respect to qualified mortgages for a temporary period, not exceeding 13 months, until the next scheduled distribution to holders of interests in a REMIC.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to the foregoing requirements, the various interests in a REMIC also must meet certain requirements. All of the interests in a REMIC must be either of the following: (i) one or more classes of regular interests; or (ii) a single class of residual interests on which distributions, if any, are made <i>pro rata</i>. A regular interest is an interest in a REMIC that is issued on the Startup Day with fixed terms, is designated as a regular interest, and unconditionally entitles the holder to receive a specified principal amount (or other similar amount), and provides that interest payments (or other similar amounts), if any, at or before maturity either are payable based on a fixed rate or a qualified variable rate, or consist of a specified, non-varying portion of the interest payments on the qualified mortgages. A residual interest is an interest in a REMIC other than a regular interest that is issued on the Startup Day that is designated as a residual interest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Although a REMIC generally is not subject to U.S. federal income tax (see, however, “—<i>Prohibited Transactions and Other Possible REMIC Taxes” </i>below), if an entity fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of the REMIC Provisions for REMIC status during any taxable year, the Code provides that the entity will not be treated as a REMIC for such year and thereafter. In that event, the entity may be taxable as a separate corporation, and the interests issued by the entity may not be accorded the status or given the tax treatment accorded to REMIC regular interests (as described below). While the Code authorizes the Treasury Department to issue regulations providing relief in the event of an inadvertent termination of REMIC status, no such regulations have been issued. Any such relief, moreover, may be accompanied by sanctions, such as the imposition of a corporate tax on all or a portion of the entity’s income for the period in which the requirements for such status are not satisfied. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will include provisions that are designed to maintain the status of any REMIC as a REMIC under the REMIC Provisions. It is not anticipated that the status of any REMIC as a REMIC will be terminated, although no assurance can be provided. If the IRS were to successfully contend that any REMIC were not a REMIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Issuing Entity likely would be treated as one or more corporations subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on its taxable income (generally, the income from the Mortgage Loans, reduced by the interest deductions, if any, on any Certificates that qualified as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes). The corporations could not be consolidated with any other entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such a characterization of the Issuing Entity likely would cause the amount of cash flow available to the holders of the Offered Certificates to be substantially reduced and could also result in the beneficial owners of the reclassified Offered Certificates recognizing income and other tax items with respect to their Certificates that differ significantly, in amount, timing and character, from that recognized were such Certificates treated, in whole or in part, as REMIC regular interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and such consequences could be materially adverse to such Certificateholders. Further, no portion of the Offered Certificates would be a qualifying asset or a REMIC regular interest for purposes of Sections 856(c)(4)(A), 7701(a)(19)(C) and 860G(a)(3) of the Code, respectively.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Characterization of Investments in Offered Certificates</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Each holder of an Offered Certificate is deemed to own (a) one or more REMIC regular interests (each such regular interest related to an Offered Certificate, a “<b>Regular Interest</b>”), (b) in the case of the Capped Certificates, the right to receive distributions from the Cap Carryover Reserve Account, and (c) with respect to the Class B-X Certificates, the obligation to make payments (solely to the extent of the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution) to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account and ownership of the Cap Carryover Reserve Account. Neither these rights or obligations nor the Cap Carryover Reserve Account is an asset of or right or obligation of any REMIC. The discussion below assumes that the arrangement under which the Capped Certificates receive and the Class B-X Certificates pay Cap Carryover Amounts will be treated as a notional principal contract for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the “<b>Notional Principal Contract</b>”). For further discussion regarding the Notional Principal Contract, see “—<i>Additional Considerations for the Component Certificates</i>” below. Investors are advised to consult their tax advisors concerning an investment in the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Taxation of Owners of Regular Interests</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">General<span class="p">. The Regular Interests generally will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as representing the ownership of newly originated debt instruments issued by a REMIC and not as ownership interests in the related REMIC or the assets of any REMIC. In general, interest, original issue discount and market discount on a Regular Interest will be treated as ordinary income to a holder, and principal distributions to a Regular Interest will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the holder’s basis allocable thereto. Moreover, holders of Regular Interests that otherwise report income including stated interest under a cash method of accounting will be required to report income with respect to the Regular Interests under an accrual method of accounting.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;"><i>Original Issue Discount</i>. For U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes, the Class A-IO-S and Class B- X Certificates will, and the other Regular Interests may, depending in part on, among other considerations, any portion of the purchase price allocated to the Notional Principal Contract and the issue price of the related Regular Interest, be treated as having been issued with original issue discount (“<b>OID</b>”). A Certificateholder must include OID in ordinary income as it accrues in accordance with the constant yield method. If a portion of the price paid for any Component Certificate were allocated to the Notional Principal Contract, the issue price of a Regular Interest could be different from the price paid for the related Component Certificate. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Regular Interest portion of the Class B-X Certificates corresponding to the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution will accrue interest on their notional amount at a rate designed to be the economic equivalent of the current interest amount described in the definition of Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution (not taking into account any Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution deposited to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account for prior Distribution Dates). Amounts that accrue for U.S. federal income tax purposes but are unpaid are taxable upon accrual and will carryforward as Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution (other than any amount paid to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account) and may be paid later in the transaction after other more senior classes are paid in full. Potential investors should be aware, however, that if the Optional Redemption is exercised, the holders of the Class B-X Certificates will not receive any such Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution upon such redemption. The Class B-X Certificates may be able to take a loss at such time, but it would likely be capital and not offset prior income accruals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Any holders of Regular Interests issued with OID generally will be required to include OID in income as it accrues, in accordance with the method described below, in advance of the receipt of the cash attributable to such income. The following discussion is based in part on the OID Regulations and in part on the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the “<b>1986 Act</b>”). Certificateholders should be aware, however, that the OID Regulations do not adequately address certain issues relevant to prepayable securities, such as the Regular Interests. To the extent such issues are not addressed in the OID Regulations, the Paying Agent will apply the methodology described in the Conference Committee Report to the 1986 Act (the “<b>Committee Report</b>”). No assurance can be provided that the IRS will not take a different position as to those matters not currently addressed by the OID Regulations. Moreover, the OID Regulations include an anti-abuse rule allowing the IRS to apply or depart from the OID Regulations where necessary or appropriate to ensure a reasonable tax result in light of the applicable statutory provisions. A tax result will not be considered unreasonable under the anti-abuse rule in the absence of a substantial effect on the present value of a taxpayer’s tax liability. In addition, Section 1272(a)(6) of the Code provides special rules applicable to any Regular Interests issued with OID. Regulations, however, have not been issued under that section. Investors are advised to consult their tax advisors as to the discussion herein and the appropriate method for reporting interest and OID with respect to the Regular Interests.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Section 1272(a)(6) of the Code requires that a prepayment assumption be used with respect to the collateral underlying debt instruments in computing the accrual of OID if payments under such debt instruments may be accelerated by reason of prepayments of other obligations securing such debt instruments, and that adjustments be made in the amount and rate of accrual of such discount to reflect differences between the actual prepayment rate and such prepayment assumption. Such prepayment assumption is to be determined in a manner prescribed in Treasury regulations. As noted above, however, those regulations have yet to be issued. The Committee Report indicates that the regulations will provide that the prepayment assumption used with respect to a Regular Interest must be the same as that used in pricing the initial offering of such Regular Interest. The prepayment assumption that will be used for purposes of computing OID, market discount or premium, if any, for</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">U.S. federal income tax purposes (the “<b>Prepayment Assumption</b>”), will be 25% CPR. No representation is made, however, that the Mortgage Loans will prepay at this rate or at any other rate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Each Regular Interest will be treated as an installment obligation for purposes of determining the OID includible in a holder’s income. The total amount of OID on a Regular Interest is the excess of the “stated redemption price at maturity” of the Regular Interest over its “issue price.” The issue price of a class of Regular Interests is the first price at which a substantial amount of Regular Interests of such class are sold to investors (excluding bond houses, brokers and underwriters). Although unclear under the OID Regulations, the Paying Agent will treat the issue price of a class of Regular Interests as to which there is no substantial sale as of the issue date as the fair market value of such class as of the issue date. The issue price of a class of Regular Interests also includes the amount paid by an initial holder of such class for accrued interest that relates to a period prior to the issue date of such class of Regular Interests. The stated redemption price at maturity of a Regular Interest is the sum of all payments provided by the debt instrument other than any qualified stated interest payments. Under the OID Regulations, qualified stated interest generally means interest payable at a single fixed rate or a qualified variable rate, provided that such interest payments are unconditionally payable at intervals of one year or less during the entire term of the obligation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding the general definition of OID, OID on a Regular Interest will be considered to be <i>de minimis </i>if it is less than 0.25% of the stated redemption price of the Regular Interest multiplied by its weighted average life. For this purpose, the weighted average life of the Regular Interest is computed as the sum of the amounts determined, as to each payment included in the stated redemption price of such Regular Interest, by multiplying (i) the number of complete years (rounding down for partial years) from the issue date until such payment is expected to be made (presumably taking into account the Prepayment Assumption) by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the payment, and the denominator of which is the stated redemption price at maturity of such Regular Interest. Under the OID Regulations, OID of only a <i>de minimis </i>amount will be included in income as each payment of stated principal is made, based on the product of the total amount of such <i>de minimis </i>OID and a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of such principal payment and the denominator of which is the outstanding stated principal amount of the Regular Interest. The OID Regulations also permit a holder to elect to accrue <i>de minimis </i>OID into income currently based on a constant yield method.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Holders of Regular Interests issued with OID generally must include in gross income for any taxable year the sum of the “daily portions,” as defined below, of the OID on the Regular Interest accrued during an accrual period for each day on which they hold the Regular Interest, including the date of purchase but excluding the date of disposition. With respect to each such Regular Interest, a calculation will be made of the OID that accrues during each successive full accrual period that ends on the day prior to each Distribution Date with respect to the Regular Interests, taking into account the Prepayment Assumption. The OID accruing in a full accrual period will be the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of (a) the present value of all of the remaining payments to be made on the Regular Interest as of the end of that accrual period and (b) the payments made on the Regular Interest during the accrual period that are included in the Regular Interest’s stated redemption price at maturity, over (ii) the adjusted issue price of the Regular Interest at the beginning of such accrual period. The present value of the remaining payments referred to in the preceding sentence is calculated based on (i) the yield to maturity of the Regular Interest as of the Startup Day, (ii) events (including actual prepayments) that have occurred prior to the end of the accrual period and (iii) the assumption that the remaining payments will be made in accordance with the original Prepayment Assumption. For these purposes, the adjusted issue price of a Regular Interest at the beginning of any accrual period equals the issue price of the Regular Interest, increased by the aggregate amount of OID with respect to the Regular Interest that accrued in all prior accrual periods and reduced by the amount of payments included in the stated redemption price at maturity of the Regular Interest that were made on the Regular Interest that were attributable to such prior periods. The OID accruing during any accrual period (as determined in this paragraph) will then be divided by the number of days in the period to determine the daily portion of OID for each day in the period.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Under the method described above, the daily portions of OID required to be included as ordinary income by a holder of a Regular Interest generally will increase to take into account prepayments on the Regular Interests as a result of prepayments on the mortgage loans that exceed the Prepayment Assumption, and generally will decrease (but not below zero for any period) if the prepayments are slower than the Prepayment Assumption.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Acquisition Premium. <span class="p">A subsequent purchaser of a Regular Interest at a price greater than its adjusted issue price and less than its remaining stated redemption price at maturity will be required to include in gross income the daily portions of the OID on the Regular Interest reduced, </span>pro rata<span class="p">, by a fraction, the numerator of which is the excess of its purchase price over such adjusted issue price and the denominator of which is the excess of the remaining stated redemption price at maturity over the adjusted issue price. Alternatively, such a purchaser may elect to treat all such acquisition premium under the constant yield method, as described below under “— </span>Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount.<span class="p">”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Market Discount. <span class="p">A Certificateholder that purchases a Regular Interest also may be subject to the market discount rules of Sections 1276 through 1278 of the Code. Under these sections of the Code and the principles applied by the OID Regulations in the context of OID, “market discount” is the amount by which the purchaser’s original basis in the Regular Interest is exceeded by the adjusted issue price of such Regular Interest at the time of a secondary purchase. Such purchaser generally will be required to recognize ordinary income to the extent of accrued market discount on such Regular Interest as payments includible in the stated redemption price at maturity thereof are received, in an amount not exceeding any such payment. Such market discount would accrue in a manner to be provided in Treasury regulations and should take into account the Prepayment Assumption. The Committee Report provides that until such regulations are issued, such market discount would accrue, at the election of the holder, either (i) on the basis of a constant interest rate or (ii) in the ratio of interest accrued for the relevant period to the sum of the interest accrued for such period plus the remaining interest after the end of such period, or, in the case of classes issued with OID, in the ratio of OID accrued for the relevant period to the sum of the OID accrued for such period plus the remaining OID after the end of such period. Such purchaser also generally will be required to treat a portion of any gain on a sale or exchange of the Regular Interest as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount accrued to the date of disposition under one of the foregoing methods, less any accrued market discount previously reported as ordinary income as partial payments in reduction of the stated redemption price at maturity were received. Such purchaser will be required to defer deduction of a portion of the excess of the interest paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry the Regular Interest over the interest (including OID) distributable thereon. The deferred portion of such interest expense in any taxable year generally will not exceed the accrued market discount on the Regular Interest for such year. Any such deferred interest expense is, in general, allowed as a deduction not later than the year in which the related market discount income is recognized or the holder disposes of the Regular Interest. As an alternative to the inclusion of market discount in income on the foregoing basis, the holder of a Regular Interest may elect to include market discount in income currently as it accrues on all market discount instruments acquired by such holder in that taxable year and thereafter, in which case the interest deferral rule will not apply. See “—</span>Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount<span class="p">” below in this Offering Memorandum regarding an alternative manner in which such election may be deemed to be made.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Market discount with respect to a Regular Interest will be considered to be zero if such market discount is less than 0.25% of the remaining stated redemption price at maturity of such Regular Interest multiplied by the weighted average maturity of the Regular Interest remaining after the date of purchase. In interpreting a similar rule with respect to OID on obligations payable in installments, the OID Regulations refer to the weighted average maturity of obligations, and it is likely that the same rule will be applied with respect to market discount, presumably taking into account the Prepayment Assumption. It appears that <i>de minimis </i>market discount would be reported <i>pro rata </i>as principal payments are received.  Treasury regulations implementing the market discount rules have not yet been issued, and investors should therefore consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules as well as the advisability of making any of the elections with respect thereto.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">To the extent that the Offered Certificates provide for monthly or other periodic payments throughout their term, the effect of these rules may be to require market discount to be includible in income at a rate that is not significantly slower than the rate at which such discount would accrue if it were OID. Moreover, in any event, a holder of a Certificate generally will be required to treat a portion of any gain on the sale or exchange of such Certificate as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount accrued to the date of disposition under one of the foregoing methods, less any accrued market discount previously reported as ordinary income.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Premium. <span class="p">A Regular Interest purchased at a cost greater than its remaining stated redemption price at maturity generally is considered to be purchased at a premium. If a holder holds such Regular Interest as a “capital</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">asset” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, the holder may elect under Section 171 of the Code to amortize such premium under the constant yield method. If made, such an election will apply to all premium debt instruments that the holder owns as of the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies and to any premium debt instrument that the holder subsequently acquires. Such election may only be revoked with the consent of the IRS. The Committee Report indicates a congressional intent that the same rules that will apply to the accrual of market discount on installment obligations will also apply to amortizing bond premium under Section 171 of the Code on installment obligations such as the Regular Interests, although it is unclear whether the alternatives to the constant interest method described above under “—<i>Market Discount</i>” are available. However, it is possible that the use of an assumption that there will be no prepayments may be required in calculating the amortization of premium. Whether any holder of the Regular Interests will be treated as holding a Regular Interest with amortizable  bond premium will  depend  on such  holder’s purchase price and the distributions remaining to be made with respect to such Regular Interest at the time of its acquisition by such holder. Holders of such Regular Interests are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possibility of making an election to amortize such premium. Amortizable bond premium will be treated as an offset to interest income on a Regular Interest rather than as a separate deduction item. See “—<i>Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount</i>” below regarding an alternative manner in which the Section 171 election may be deemed to be made.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount. <span class="p">A holder of a debt instrument such as a Regular Interest may elect to treat all interest that accrues on the instrument using the constant yield method, with none of the interest being treated as qualified stated interest. For purposes of applying the constant yield method to a debt instrument subject to such an election, (i) “interest” includes stated interest, OID, </span>de minimis <span class="p">OID, market discount and </span>de minimis <span class="p">market discount, as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or acquisition premium and (ii) the debt instrument is treated as if the instrument were issued on the holder’s acquisition date in the amount of the holder’s adjusted basis immediately after acquisition. It is unclear whether, for this purpose, the initial Prepayment Assumption would continue to apply or if a new prepayment assumption as of the date of the holder’s acquisition would apply. A holder generally may make such an election on an instrument by instrument basis or for a class or group of debt instruments. However, if the holder makes such an election with respect to a debt instrument with amortizable bond premium or with market discount, the holder is deemed to have made elections to amortize bond premium or to report market discount income currently as it accrues under the constant yield method, respectively, for all premium bonds held or market discount bonds acquired by the holder in the same taxable year and thereafter. The election is made on the holder’s U.S. federal income tax return for the year in which the debt instrument is acquired and is irrevocable except with the approval of the IRS. Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the advisability of making such an election.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Treatment of Losses. <span class="p">Holders of Regular Interests will be required to report income with respect thereto on the accrual method without giving effect to delays and reductions in distributions attributable to defaults or delinquencies on any of the assets of the REMICs, except possibly, in the case of income that under the Code constitutes “qualified stated interest,” to the extent that it can be established that such amounts are uncollectible. In addition, potential investors are cautioned that while they may generally cease to accrue interest income if it reasonably appears that the interest will be uncollectible, the IRS may take the position that OID must continue to be accrued in spite of its uncollectibility until the Certificate is disposed of in a taxable transaction or becomes worthless in accordance with the rules under Section 166 of the Code. As a result, the amount of income required to be reported by a holder in any period could exceed the amount of cash distributed to such holder in that period.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Although not entirely clear, it appears that (i) holders of Regular Interests that are corporations should in general be allowed to deduct as an ordinary loss any loss sustained during the taxable year on account of any such Regular Interests becoming wholly or partially worthless and (ii) holders of Regular Interests that are not corporations generally should be allowed to deduct as a short-term capital loss any loss sustained during the taxable year on account of any such Regular Interests becoming wholly worthless. Although the matter is not entirely clear, non-corporate holders of Regular Interests may be allowed a bad debt deduction at such time that the principal balance of any such Regular Interests is reduced to reflect Applied Realized Loss Amounts resulting from any liquidated mortgage assets. The IRS, however, could take the position that non-corporate holders will be allowed a bad debt deduction to reflect Applied Realized Loss Amounts only after all Mortgage Loans and Mortgaged Properties remaining in the related REMIC have been liquidated or the Regular Interests have been otherwise retired. The IRS could also assert that losses on a class of Regular Interests are deductible based on some other method that may defer such deductions for all holders, such as reducing future cash flow for purposes of computing OID. This may have the effect of creating “negative” OID which, with the possible exception of the method discussed in the following sentence, would be deductible only against future positive OID or otherwise upon termination of the applicable class. Although not free from doubt, a holder of a Regular Interest with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">negative OID may be entitled to deduct a loss to the extent that its remaining basis would exceed the maximum amount of future payments to which such holder was entitled, assuming no further prepayments (or, perhaps, assuming prepayments at the Prepayment Assumption). Potential investors and holders of the Regular Interests are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the appropriate timing, amount and character of any loss sustained with respect to Regular Interests, including any loss resulting from the failure to recover previously accrued interest or discount income. Special loss rules are applicable to banks and thrift institutions, including rules regarding reserves for bad debts. Such taxpayers are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the treatment of losses on Regular Interests.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sales of Offered Certificates</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If an Offered Certificate is sold, the selling holder will recognize gain or loss on the related Regular Interest equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale and its adjusted basis in the Regular Interest. The adjusted basis of a Regular Interest generally will equal the cost of such Regular Interest to the seller, increased by any interest, OID or market discount previously included in the seller’s gross income with respect to the Regular Interest and reduced (but not below zero) by payments, actual or deemed, in respect of such Regular Interest, any amortization premium and any deductible losses thereon. See “—<i>Additional Considerations for the Component Certificates</i>” below for the treatment of the sale of any portion of a Component Certificate treated as a Notional Principal Contract.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Except as described above with respect to market discount, and except as provided in this paragraph, any gain or loss on the sale or exchange of a Regular Interest realized by an investor who holds the related Regular Interest as a capital asset generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term or short-term depending on whether the Regular Interest has been held for the long-term capital gain holding period (more than one year). Such gain will be treated as ordinary income (i) if the Regular Interest is held as part of a “conversion transaction” as defined in Section 1258(c) of the Code, up to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the holder’s net investment in the conversion transaction at 120% of the appropriate applicable federal rate under Section 1274(d) of the Code in effect at the time the taxpayer entered into the transaction minus any amount previously treated as ordinary income with respect to any prior disposition of property that was held as part of such transaction, (ii) in the case of a non-corporate taxpayer, to the extent such taxpayer has made an election under Section 163(d)(4) of the Code to have net capital gains taxed as investment income at ordinary income rates, or</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to the extent that such gain does not exceed the excess, if any, of (a) the amount that would have been includible in the gross income of the holder if the yield on such Regular Interest were 110% of the applicable federal rate as of the date of purchase, over (b) the amount of income actually includible in the gross income of such holder with respect to the Regular Interest. In addition, gain or loss recognized from the sale of a Regular Interest by certain banks or thrift institutions will be treated as ordinary income or loss pursuant to Section 582(c) of the Code. Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the sale of an Offered Certificate.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Except as described above, the Offered Certificates will be “evidences of indebtedness” within the meaning of Section 582(c)(1) of the Code, so that gain or loss recognized from the sale of a Certificate by a bank or thrift institution to which such section applies will be ordinary income or loss.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Additional Considerations for the Component Certificates</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The treatment of amounts deemed received or deemed paid by a holder of a Component Certificate in respect of the Notional Principal Contract (defined below) will depend on the portion, if any, of such holder’s purchase price allocable thereto. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides that each holder of the Capped Certificates owns a beneficial interest in (i) a Regular Interest (the “<b>Capped Certificate REMIC Portion</b>”) and (ii) the right to receive distributions from the Cap Carryover Reserve Account (the “<b>Capped Certificate Cap Component</b>”). A beneficial owner of a Capped Certificate must allocate its purchase price for such Certificate in accordance with the relative fair market values of the Capped Certificate REMIC Portion and the Capped Certificate Cap Component. The Capped Certificate REMIC Portions generally will be entitled to receive interest and principal distributions at the times and in the amounts equal to those made on the related Certificate to which it corresponds, except that for U.S. federal income tax purposes the interest rate for the Capped Certificate REMIC Portions will at all times be limited by the Net WAC Rate. Cap Carryover Amounts will be calculated based on the Net WAC Rate and any amounts distributed to the Capped Certificates from the Cap Carryover Reserve Account will not be treated as distributable in respect of the Capped Certificate REMIC Portion of the related Certificate but instead as paid to the Capped Certificate Cap Component in respect of the Notional Principal Contract.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides that each holder of the Class B-X Certificates owns in respect of the Class B-X Additional Monthly Distribution a beneficial interest in (i) one or more Regular Interests (the “<b>Class B-X REMIC Portion</b>,” and together with the Capped Certificate REMIC Portion, the “<b>REMIC Portions</b>”), (ii) an obligation to pay amounts representing any aggregate Cap Carryover Amounts with respect to each Distribution Date to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account (the “<b>Class B- X Cap Component</b>,” and together with the Capped Certificate Cap Component, the “<b>Cap Components</b>”), and</p><ol id="l50"><li><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ownership of the Cap Carryover Reserve Account. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Class B-X REMIC Portion generally will accrue interest in the manner described for the Class B-X Certificates to which it corresponds, except that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Class B-X REMIC Portion will have an obligation to pay Cap Carryover Amounts to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account from amounts received in respect of its Class B-X REMIC Portion. Once these amounts are paid to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account, the Class B-X Certificates will no longer have any rights to these amounts. Accordingly, the holder of a Class B- X Certificate will be required to accrue interest (including OID) with respect to its Class B-X REMIC Portion as described for the Regular Interest related to its Class B-X REMIC Portion. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the purchase price for the Class B-X REMIC Portion must include any upfront payment deemed made to the holders of the Class B-X Certificates for entering into the Class B-X Cap Component.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If a holder owns both a Capped Certificate and a Class B-X Certificate, the Notional Principal Contract could be treated as not in existence for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but the relative fair market values of the REMIC regular interest portion generally would be unaffected for U.S. federal income tax purposes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Any amounts a beneficial owner of a Component Certificate is considered to have received for entering into the Notional Principal Contract should be amortized and taken into income as described below and in accordance with the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of notional principal contracts (the “<b>Notional Principal Contract Regulations</b>”) and such amounts should increase such Certificateholder’s basis in the Cap Component portion of their Certificate. Although the matter is not clear, in addition to the consequences described below regarding any swap portion of the Notional Principal Contract, if any imputed payment is considered a non- periodic payment under the Notional Principal Contract Regulations, such imputed payment is deemed to be a loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the payment is “significant.” It is not known whether any such payment will be deemed to be made, would be treated as non-periodic or would be treated as “significant.” If all of these occurred, such imputed payment would be treated as two separate transactions consisting of one or more loans and an on-market, level payment swap. Any such loan would have to be accounted for separately from the swap portion, the time-value component associated with the loan would be recognized as interest for all U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the loan would be repaid over the expected life of the related REMIC Portions. As a result of these potential tax consequences, such Certificates may not be a suitable investment for certain investors, and potential investors of the Component Certificates are strongly encouraged to consult their tax advisors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A beneficial owner of a Class B-X Certificate will be required to accrue income with respect to its respective Class B-X REMIC Portion and may be able to take deductions with respect to its obligations in respect of the Class B-X Cap Component. To the extent the Class B-X Certificates are required to make payments to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account, the holders of the Class B-X Certificates likely will be required to recognize income in an amount greater than the amount of distributions to which the holder receives in respect of their Certificates. As a result, such Certificates may not be an appropriate investment for any investor whose ability to take such deductions would be limited as described below, and potential investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of an investment in the Class B-X Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Paying Agent will, as required, treat payments made or paid in respect of the Notional Principal Contract as includible in income based on the Notional Principal Contract Regulations. The OID Regulations (defined above) provide that the Issuing Entity’s allocation of the issue price is binding on all holders unless the holder explicitly discloses on its tax return that its allocation is different from the Issuing Entity’s allocation. Although the matter is not entirely clear and no assurance can be provided as to the value below, for U.S. federal income tax information reporting purposes, as of the Closing Date, the Issuing Entity intends to take the position that the distributions from the Cap Carryover Reserve Account and any premium in respect of the Notional Principal Contract have an insubstantial value. The Notional Principal Contract is, however, difficult to value, and the IRS could assert that the value of the Notional Principal Contract as of the Closing Date or at a later date is greater than the value used for information reporting purposes. Any change in this position could have material negative tax consequences for investors in the Component Certificates, including if any portion of the Notional Principal Contract were treated as loan as described above. In addition, the REMIC Portion could be viewed as having been issued with either an additional amount of OID (which could cause the total amount of discount to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">exceed a statutorily defined de minimis amount) or with less premium (which would reduce the amount of premium available to be used as an offset against interest income). In addition, such Cap Component could be viewed as having been purchased at a higher cost. Accordingly, potential investors in such Certificates are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of issue price, timing, character and source of income and deductions resulting from the ownership of the Component Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Treasury regulations have been promulgated under Section 1275 of the Code generally providing for the integration of a “qualifying debt instrument” with a hedge if the combined cash flows of the components are substantially equivalent to the cash flows on a variable rate debt instrument. However, such regulations specifically disallow integration of debt instruments subject to Section 1272(a)(6) of the Code. Therefore, holders of the Component Certificates likely will be unable to use the integration method provided for under such regulations with respect to such Certificates. If the Paying Agent’s treatment of distributions from the Cap Carryover Reserve Account is respected, ownership of the right to distributions from the Cap Carryover Reserve Account should entitle the owner to amortize the separate price paid for the right to distributions from or the premium paid for such obligation to make payments to the Cap Carryover Reserve Account under the Notional Principal Contract Regulations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Any amount paid to a beneficial owner in respect of the Cap Component in excess of the amounts accrued in respect of the related REMIC Portion generally should be treated as having been received as a “periodic payment” in respect of a notional principal contract, although see the discussion above concerning non-period payments. If treated as a periodic payment, for any taxable year, to the extent the sum of the periodic payment received exceeds the amortization of purchase price of the Cap Component, such excess is income. Conversely, to the extent that the amount of that year’s amortized cost exceeds the sum of the periodic payments, such excess generally should represent a net deduction for that year. Although not clear, net income or a net deduction with respect to the Notional Principal Contract should be treated as ordinary income or as an ordinary deduction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In the case of an individual beneficially owning an interest in the Notional Principal Contract, to the extent a deduction constitutes a “miscellaneous itemized deduction” within the meaning of Section 67 of the Code, for tax years through December 31, 2025 such deduction will be disallowed and for tax years after December 31, 2025, such deduction will be subject to the 2% floor imposed on miscellaneous itemized deductions under Section 67 of the Code and may be subject to the overall limitation on itemized deductions imposed under Section 68 of the Code. In addition, miscellaneous itemized deductions are not allowed for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Upon the sale, exchange, or other disposition of a Component Certificate, the beneficial owner of such Certificate must allocate the amount realized between the REMIC Portion and the Cap Component based on the relative fair market values of those components at the time of sale and must treat the sale, exchange or other disposition as a sale, exchange or disposition of the REMIC Portion and the Cap Component. Assuming that such Certificate is held as a “capital asset” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, gain or loss on the disposition of an interest in the Notional Principal Contract component should be capital gain or loss. The portion of the sale price allocated to the Cap Component generally would be considered a “termination payment” under the Notional Principal Contract Regulations. A holder of a Component Certificate generally will have gain or loss from a termination of the Cap Component equal to (i) any termination payment it received or is deemed to have received minus (ii) the unamortized portion of any amount paid (or deemed paid) by the Certificateholder upon entering into or acquiring its interest in the right to receive payments in respect of the Cap Component. Assuming that such Certificate is held as a “capital asset” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, gain or loss on the disposition of an interest in the Notional Principal Contract component should be capital gain or loss. However, in the case of a bank or thrift institution, Section 582(c) of the Code likely would not be expected to apply to treat such gain or loss as ordinary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">It is possible that the Notional Principal Contract could be treated as a partnership or a guarantee arrangement among the holders of the Component Certificates, in which case holders of such Certificates potentially would be subject to different timing of income and foreign holders of such Certificates could be subject to U.S. withholding in respect of any distribution made or deemed to be made to enter into such agreement or deemed received as payment for the provision of a guarantee in respect of such Notional Principal Contract or other negative tax results. Holders of the Component Certificates are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of issue price, timing, character and source of income and deductions and possible withholding resulting from their interests in the Notional Principal Contract.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Status as Real Property Loans</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">With respect to the Offered Certificates, this paragraph is relevant only to the Regular Interest portion of the Offered Certificates and not the Notional Principal Contract. The Regular Interests will be treated as assets described in Section 7701(a)(19)(C) of the Code and “real estate assets” under Section 856(c)(4)(A) of the Code generally in the same proportion that the assets of the Issuing Entity would be so treated. Moreover, if 95% or more of the assets of a REMIC qualify for any of the foregoing treatments at all times during a calendar year, the Regular Interests will qualify for the corresponding status in their entirety for that calendar year. The determination as to the percentage of a REMIC’s assets that constitute assets described in the foregoing sections of the Code will be made with respect to each calendar quarter based on the average adjusted basis of each category of the assets held by the REMIC during such calendar quarter. The Paying Agent will report those determinations to Certificateholders in the manner and at the times required by applicable Treasury regulations. In addition, interest on the Regular Interests will be treated as “interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property” under Section 856(c)(3)(B) of the Code generally to the extent that such Regular Interests are treated as “real estate assets” under Section 856(c)(4)(A) of the Code. The Regular Interests will also be “qualified mortgages” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code if transferred to another REMIC on its Startup Day in exchange for a regular or residual interest therein.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Because the Notional Principal Contract is not part of any REMIC or part of any Regular Interest, the Notional Principal Contract will not be treated as qualifying assets as described above. Accordingly, the Component Certificates may not be a suitable investment for certain investors and potential investors in the Component Certificates should contact their tax advisors concerning an investment in the Component Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prohibited Transactions and Other Possible REMIC Taxes</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Code imposes a tax on REMICs equal to 100% of the net income derived from “prohibited transactions” (a “<b>Prohibited Transactions Tax</b>”). In general, subject to certain specified exceptions, a prohibited transaction means the disposition of a Mortgage Loan, the receipt of income from a source other than an underlying Mortgage Loan or certain other permitted investments, the receipt of compensation for services, or gain from the disposition of an asset purchased with the payments on a Mortgage Loan for temporary investment pending payment to the Regular Interests. Net gain on the sale of assets of a REMIC pursuant to a qualified liquidation is not subject to the Prohibited Transactions Tax, as described in more detail below. Modifications of mortgage loans entered into after they have been contributed to a REMIC and before the loan is classified as defaulted could cause a REMIC to incur a Prohibited Transactions Tax or to violate certain requirements necessary to maintain its tax status as a REMIC. Recent COVID-19 related mortgage loan forbearance and deferral programs could result in prohibited transactions or loss of REMIC status. The IRS previously issued the COVID-19 Revenue Procedure that generally exempted REMICs holding loans related to these programs from adverse tax consequences. The COVID-19 Revenue Procedure expired on September 30, 2021. It is not clear whether the IRS will extend the application of the COVID-19 Revenue Procedure or issue new guidance for forbearances and related modifications for mortgage loans in REMICs granted after September 30, 2021. It is not anticipated that any REMIC will engage in any prohibited transactions in which it would recognize a material amount of net income.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, certain contributions to a REMIC made after the day on which the REMIC issues all of its interests could result in the imposition of a tax on the REMIC equal to 100% of the value of the contributed property. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will include provisions designed to prevent the acceptance of any contributions that would be subject to such tax.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">REMICs also are subject to U.S. federal income tax at the highest corporate rate on “net income from foreclosure property,” determined by reference to the rules applicable to real estate investment trusts. “Net income from foreclosure property” generally means gain from the sale of a foreclosure property that is inventory property and gross income from foreclosure property other than qualifying rents and other qualifying income for a real estate investment trust. It is not anticipated that any REMIC will recognize “net income from foreclosure property” subject to U.S. federal income tax.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">If a REMIC adopts a plan of complete liquidation, within the meaning of Section 860F(a)(4)(A)(i) of the Code, which may be accomplished by designating in the REMIC’s final tax return a date on which such adoption is deemed to occur, and sells all assets (other than cash) within a 90 day period beginning on such date, the REMIC will recognize no gain or loss on the sale of its assets, <i>provided </i>that the REMIC credits or distributes in liquidation</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">all of the sale proceeds plus its cash (other than amounts retained to meet claims) to holders of regular and residual interests within the 90-day period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Termination</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Each REMIC will terminate immediately after the Distribution Date following receipt by the Issuing Entity of the final payment in respect of the Mortgage Loans or upon a sale of the Issuing Entity’s assets following the adoption by the applicable REMIC of a plan of complete liquidation. The last payment on a Regular Interest will be treated as a payment in retirement of a debt instrument.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reporting and Other Administrative Matters</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Solely for purposes of the administrative provisions of the Code, each REMIC will be treated as a partnership. The books of a REMIC must be maintained on a calendar year basis, and the REMIC must file an annual U.S. federal income tax return. A REMIC also will generally be subject to the procedural and administrative rules of the Code applicable to partnerships, discussed in more detail below regarding partnership audits, including the determination of any adjustments to, among other things, items of REMIC income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit, by the IRS.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Paying Agent will file U.S. federal income tax returns on behalf of each REMIC, and under the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Paying Agent will be appointed as the “partnership representative” with respect to the related REMIC in all respects. Solely for purposes of the administrative provisions of the Code, each REMIC constituting the Issuing Entity will be treated as a partnership and the related holders of the Class R Certificates will be treated as partners. As the partnership representative, the Paying Agent will, subject to certain notice requirements and various restrictions and limitations, generally have the authority to act on behalf of each REMIC and the related holders of the Class R Certificates in connection with the administrative and judicial review of items of income, deduction, gain or loss of the REMICs as well as any REMIC’s classification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Partnerships, their partners and the persons that are authorized to represent entities treated as partnerships are subject to certain partnership audit rules in IRS audits and related procedures. These rules also apply to new and existing REMICs, the holders of REMIC residual interests and the trustees or administrators authorized to represent REMICs in IRS audits and related procedures. Under these rules, unless a REMIC elects otherwise, taxes arising from IRS audit adjustments are required to be paid by the REMIC rather than by its residual interest holders. The Paying Agent will have the authority to utilize, and will be directed to utilize, any exceptions available under the partnership audit rules and related Treasury regulations so that the holders of the Class R Certificates, to the fullest extent possible, rather than any REMIC itself, will be liable for any taxes arising from audit adjustments to the REMIC’s taxable income. Each REMIC residual interest holder is required under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to be a C Corporation and to provide identifying information and otherwise cooperate with the REMIC to allow it to make such elections. It is not entirely clear how any such exceptions may affect the procedural rules available to challenge any audit adjustment that would otherwise be available in the absence of any such exceptions. Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible effect of these rules on them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Reporting of interest income, including any OID, with respect to Regular Interests is required annually, and may be required more frequently under Treasury regulations. These information reports generally are required to be sent to individual holders of regular interests and the IRS. Holders of Regular Interests that are corporations, trusts, securities dealers and certain other non-individuals will be provided interest and OID income information and the information set forth in the following paragraph upon request in accordance with the requirements of the applicable Treasury regulations. The information must be provided by the later of 30 days after the end of the quarter for which the information was requested, or two weeks after the receipt of the request. Reporting with respect to the residual interests, including income, excess inclusions, investment expenses and relevant information regarding qualification of the related REMIC’s assets will be made as required under the Treasury regulations, generally on a quarterly basis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">As applicable, the Regular Interest information reports will include a statement of the adjusted issue prices of the Regular Interests at the beginning of each accrual period. In addition, the reports will include information required by regulations with respect to computing the accrual of any market discount. Because exact computation of the accrual of market discount on a constant yield method requires information relating to the holder’s purchase price that the Paying Agent may not have, such regulations only require that information</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pertaining to the appropriate proportionate method of accruing market discount be provided. See “<i>—Taxation of Owners of Regular Interests—Market Discount</i>” herein.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Paying Agent will also be responsible for income tax reporting in respect of the arrangement relating to the Notional Principal Contract, and will furnish the holders of Component Certificates with information from time to time in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. There can be no assurance the IRS will agree with the Paying Agent’s information reports of these items, particularly in respect of the Notional Principal Contract, as the timing and amount of income, gain, deduction and loss in respect of the Notional Principal Contract are uncertain in various respects. Moreover, these information reports, even if otherwise accepted as accurate by the IRS, may in any event only be accurate as to initial holders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The responsibility for complying with the foregoing reporting rules will be borne by the Paying Agent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backup Withholding With Respect to Offered Certificates</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Distributions of interest and principal, as well as distributions of proceeds from the sale of Offered Certificates, may be subject to the “backup withholding tax” under Section 3406 of the Code if recipients of such distributions fail to furnish to the payor certain information, including their taxpayer identification numbers, or otherwise fail to establish an exemption from such tax. Any amounts deducted and withheld from a distribution to a recipient would be allowed as a credit against such recipient’s U.S. federal income tax. Furthermore, certain penalties may be imposed by the IRS on a recipient of distributions that is required to supply information but that does not do so in the proper manner.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Medicare Tax on Unearned Income</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Certain Certificateholders that are individuals, estates, or trusts (other than nonresident alien individuals or a special exempt class of trusts), will be subject to a Medicare tax at a rate of 3.8% on all or a portion of their “net investment income” for the relevant taxable year. A Certificateholder’s “net investment income” generally may include, among other things, interest and gain on the disposition of the Offered Certificates if the Offered Certificates were not held in a trade or business or were held in a trade or business that is a passive activity with respect to the taxpayer or consists of trading financial instruments or commodities (as defined in Section 475(e)(2) of the Code). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. Holders of the Offered Certificates should consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to an investment in the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Foreign Investors in Offered Certificates</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">A holder of an Offered Certificate that is a Non-U.S. Tax Person that is not subject to U.S. federal income tax as a result of any direct or indirect connection to the United States in addition to its ownership of the related Regular Interest generally is not expected to be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax in respect of a distribution on a Regular Interest, provided that the Non-U.S. Tax Person complies to the extent necessary with certain identification requirements (including delivery of a statement, signed by the Non-U.S. Tax Person under penalties of perjury, certifying that Non-U.S. Tax Person is not a U.S. Tax Person and providing the name and address of such Non-U.S. Tax Person) and is not subject to certain exceptions. This statement is generally made on IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY (with appropriate attachments) and must be updated whenever required information has changed or by the end of the third calendar year beginning after the statement was last delivered.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">To the extent prescribed in regulations by the Secretary of the Treasury, a trust which was in existence on August 20, 1996 (other than a trust treated as owned by the grantor under subpart E of part I of subchapter J of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code), and which was treated as a U.S. Tax Person on August 19, 1996, may elect to continue to be treated as a U.S. Tax Person. It is possible that the IRS may assert that the foregoing tax exemption should not apply with respect to a Regular Interest held by a holder of Class R Certificates that owns directly or indirectly a 10% or greater interest in the Class R Certificates. If a Certificate is held through a securities clearing organization or certain other financial institutions, the organization or institution may provide the relevant signed statement to the withholding agent; in that case, however, the signed statement must be accompanied by the applicable IRS Form W-8 provided by the Certificateholder that owns the Certificate. If the holder does not qualify for exemption, distributions of interest, including distributions in respect of accrued OID, to such holder may be subject to a tax rate of 30%, subject to reduction under any applicable tax treaty.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Any capital gain realized on the sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Certificateholder by a Certificateholder that is not a U.S. Tax Person will be exempt from United States federal income and withholding tax, provided that (i) such gain is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the Certificateholder and (ii) in the case of a Certificateholder that is not a U.S. Tax Person who is an individual, the Certificateholder is not present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Although it is not entirely clear, it is not expected that distributions received by a holder of a Component Certificate with respect to the Notional Principal Contract portion of such Certificate will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax so long as the Notional Principal Contract is respected as a notional principal contract for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, alternate characterizations are possible, which could result in withholding for foreign Certificateholders of the Component Certificates, particularly of the Class B-X Certificates, and prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of U.S. federal withholding tax to distributions received on the Notional Principal Contract portion of the Component Certificates, if applicable. See “—<i>Characterization of Investments in Offered Certificates</i>” and “<i>—Additional Considerations for the Component Certificates</i>” in this Offering Memorandum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FATCA Regime</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">FATCA imposes U.S. withholding tax on certain payments of interest paid to certain foreign financial institutions and non-financial foreign entities that fail to take required steps to provide information regarding their “United States accounts” or their direct or indirect “substantial United States owners,” as applicable, or to certify that they have no such accounts or owners. Various exceptions are provided under the legislation and related administrative guidance. Foreign investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application and impact of FATCA based upon their particular circumstances. The Issuing Entity will not be obligated to pay any additional amounts to “gross up” distributions to the Certificateholders as a result of any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or government charges with respect to distributions in respect of the Offered Certificates, including under FATCA. Each Certificateholder of a Certificate or an interest therein, by acceptance of such Certificate or such interest in such Certificate, will be deemed to have agreed to provide the Paying Agent with information to avoid FATCA withholding. In addition, each Certificateholder will be deemed to understand and agree that the Paying Agent has the right to withhold under FATCA on distributions to any  Certificateholder that are properly withholdable under law without corresponding gross-up if required FATCA information is not provided.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Special rules apply to partnerships, estates and trusts, and in certain circumstances certifications as to foreign status and other matters may be required to be provided by partners and beneficiaries thereof.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, in certain circumstances, the foregoing rules will not apply to exempt a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation from taxation on such United States shareholder’s allocable portion of the interest income received by such controlled foreign corporation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The Issuing Entity will not be obligated to pay any additional amounts to “gross up” payments to the Certificateholders or beneficial owners of the Offered Certificates as a result of any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or government charges with respect to payments in respect of such Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the procedures for obtaining an exemption from withholding or reporting under the withholding, backup withholding and information reporting rules described above.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tax Return Disclosure Requirements</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Legislation and Treasury Department pronouncements directed at abusive tax shelter activity appear to apply to transactions not conventionally regarded as tax shelters. Taxpayers are required to report certain information on IRS Form 8886 if they participate in a “reportable transaction” (as defined under U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 6011 of the Code). A penalty in the amount of $10,000 in the case of a natural person and $50,000 in any other case is imposed on any taxpayer that fails to file timely an information return with the IRS with respect to a “reportable transaction.” The rules defining “reportable transactions” are complex and include, among other categories of transactions, transactions that result in certain losses that exceed</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">threshold amounts.

State, local and foreign tax law may differ substantially from the corresponding U.S. federal tax law, and this discussion does not purport to describe any aspect of the tax laws of any state or other jurisdiction. Therefore, prospective investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to the various tax consequences of investments in the Offered Certificates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">ERISA CONSIDERATIONS</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Section 406 of ERISA prohibits, and Section 4975 of the Code imposes adverse tax consequences on, certain transactions between employee benefit plans as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, including pension, profit-sharing or other retirement plans, that are subject to Title I of ERISA, “plans” as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, including so-called “Keogh” plans, or an individual retirement accounts, educational savings accounts, that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or any entity whose underlying assets are deemed to include plan assets by reason of such employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity, including insurance company general and separate accounts (each a “<b>Plan</b>”) and persons having obtained specific relationships to such a Plan, referred to as &quot;parties in interest&quot; under Section 3(14) of ERISA or &quot;disqualified persons&quot; under Section 4975 of the Code with respect to such Plan (collectively, “<b>Parties in Interest</b>”). ERISA also imposes certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of Plans subject to ERISA, including the requirements of investment prudence and diversification, and the requirement that investments of any such Plan be made in accordance with the documents governing the Plan. Under ERISA, any person who exercises any authority or control respecting the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA-governed Plan or renders investment advice for a fee with respect to such Plan&#39;s assets, is considered to be a fiduciary of the Plan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Some plans, including governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), plans maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are non-residential aliens as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA and certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) if no election has been made under Section 410(d) of the Code, are not subject to ERISA requirements or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code; provided, however, that such governmental, church or non-U.S. plans may be subject to federal, state, local or other laws that are substantially similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”). It also should be noted that any such plans may be subject to other provisions of federal law, including, for example, in the case of any plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, the restrictions imposed under Section 503 of the Code. Subject to the considerations and transfer restrictions set forth below, the Offered Certificates may be acquired by, on behalf of, or using assets of, a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan subject to Similar Law.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to imposing general fiduciary standards, ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit a broad range of “prohibited transactions” involving assets of Plans and, as relevant here, the acquisition, holding and disposition of certificates between a Plan and persons that are Parties in Interest with respect to such Plan and impose taxes and/or other penalties under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code on such transactions, unless a statutory or regulatory exception or administrative exemption applies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, certain transactions involving the assets of a trust might be deemed to constitute prohibited transactions under ERISA and the Code with respect to a Plan that purchases certificates issued by that trust if assets of the trust were deemed to be assets of the Plan.

An equity interest is defined under the Plan Assets Regulation as an interest other than an interest which is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantial equity features. An Offered Certificate will normally be treated as an equity interest for these purposes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Purchases of Offered Certificates based upon the Underwriter’s Exemption</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The DOL has granted to each of the Initial Purchasers or an affiliate thereof an administrative exemption, as most recently amended and restated by PTE 2013-08 (the “<b>Exemption</b>”) from certain of the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the related excise tax provisions of Section 4975 of the Code with respect to the initial purchase, holding and subsequent resale by Plans of asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities issued by entities, such as the Issuing Entity, that hold certain fixed pools of secured receivables, and other obligations of the types held by the Issuing Entity such as the Mortgage Loans and the servicing, operation and management of the Issuing Entity and its assets, provided that the conditions and requirements of the Exemption are met.

However, it should be noted that the rating of an ERISA Eligible Certificate may change at any time. If the Minimum ERISA Rating Requirement is not met with respect to a class of ERISA Eligible Certificates, the Certificates of that class may no longer be eligible for relief under the Exemption, although a Plan that had purchased a Certificate of that class when the Certificate did meet the Minimum ERISA Rating Requirement would not be required to dispose of it.

Therefore, the sale of the ERISA Eligible Certificates to the Depositor pursuant to the Optional Redemption must separately satisfy an administrative or statutory prohibited transaction exemption. These exemptions include, but are not limited to, PTCE 90-1 (regarding investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (regarding investments by bank collective funds), PTCE 84-14 (regarding investment decisions made by qualified professional asset managers), PTCE 95-60 (regarding investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (regarding investment decisions by in-house asset managers) (collectively, the “<b>Investor-Based Class Exemptions</b>”). In addition, certain statutory prohibited transaction exemptions may be available to provide exemptive relief for a Plan, including, without limitation, the statutory exemption set forth in Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code regarding transactions with certain service providers (the “<b>Statutory Exemption</b>”). It should be noted that even if the conditions specified in one or more of the prohibited transaction exemptions described above (or any similar administrative or statutory exemption) are met, the scope of the relief provided may or may not cover all acts associated with the sale of the ERISA Eligible Certificates pursuant to the Optional Redemption that could be construed as prohibited transactions.

However, in the event that any such Offered Certificate is subsequently the subject of an ERISA Qualifying Underwriting, such Offered Certificate may be acquired under the same conditions as are described above for other Offered Certificates that are eligible under either the Exemption and/or Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60, and the Investor-Based Class Exemptions, as applicable.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Any member of the Restricted Group, a mortgagor or obligor, or any of their affiliates might be considered or might become a Party in Interest with respect to a Plan.

Accordingly, before a Plan investor makes the investment decision to purchase, to commit to purchase or to hold any Offered Certificates, the Plan investor should make its own determination as to whether the Exemption is applicable and adequate exemptive relief is available thereunder or whether any other prohibited transaction exemption is available under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Insurance companies contemplating the investment of general account assets in the Offered Certificates should also consult with their legal advisors with respect to the applicability of Section 401(c) of ERISA, and the DOL regulations issued thereunder regarding the potential application to, and exemption from, the fiduciary and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code to such accounts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">The sale of any Class A, Class M or Class B Certificates to a Plan or a governmental plan, church plan or non U.S. plan subject to Similar Law will not constitute a representation by the Sponsor, the Depositor, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar, the Servicer or the Master Servicer that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements relating to investments by such Plans or plans generally or by any particular Plan or plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for such Plans or plans generally or for any particular Plan or plans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: justify;">Prospective Plan investors should consult with their legal advisors concerning the impact of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, the effect of the assets of the Issuing Entity being deemed “plan assets” and satisfy themselves as to the applicability of the Exemption, PTCE 95-60, the other Investor-Based Class Exemptions, the Statutory Exemption or any other applicable exemption prior to making an investment in the Class A, Class M or Class B Certificates.
